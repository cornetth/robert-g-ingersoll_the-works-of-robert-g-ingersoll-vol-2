      PREFACE.
    </h2>
<p>
      For many years I have regarded the Pentateuch simply as a record of a
      barbarous people, in which are found a great number of the ceremonies of
      savagery, many absurd and unjust laws, and thousands of ideas inconsistent
      with known and demonstrated facts. To me it seemed almost a crime to teach
      that this record was written by inspired men; that slavery, polygamy, wars
      of conquest and extermination were right, and that there was a time when
      men could win the approbation of infinite Intelligence, Justice, and
      Mercy, by violating maidens and by butchering babes. To me it seemed more
      reasonable that savage men had made these laws; and I endeavored in a
      lecture, entitled "Some Mistakes of Moses," to point out some of the
      errors, contradictions, and impossibilities contained in the Pentateuch.
      The lecture was never written and consequently never delivered twice the
      same. On several occasions it was reported and published without consent,
      and without revision. All these publications were grossly and glaringly
      incorrect As published, they have been answered several hundred times, and
      many of the clergy are still engaged in the great work. To keep these
      reverend gentlemen from wasting their talents on the mistakes of reporters
      and printers, I concluded to publish the principal points in all my
      lectures on this subject. And here, it may be proper for me to say, that
      arguments cannot be answered by personal abuse; that there is no logic in
      slander, and that falsehood, in the long run, defeats itself. People who
      love their enemies should, at least, tell the truth about their friends.
      Should it turn out that I am the worst man in the whole world, the story
      of the flood will remain just as improbable as before, and the
      contradictions of the Pentateuch will still demand an explanation.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a time when a falsehood, fulminated from the pulpit, smote like
      a sword; but, the supply having greatly exceeded the demand, clerical
      misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent amusement.
      Remembering that only a few years ago men, women, and even children, were
      imprisoned, tortured and burned, for having expressed in an exceedingly
      mild and gentle way, the ideas entertained by me, I congratulate myself
      that calumny is now the pulpit's last resort. The old instruments of
      torture are kept only to gratify curiosity; the chains are rusting away,
      and the demolition of time has allowed even the dungeons of the
      Inquisition to be visited by light. The church, impotent and malicious,
      regrets, not the abuse, but the loss of her power, and seeks to hold by
      falsehood what she gained by cruelty and force, by fire and fear.
      Christianity cannot live in peace with any other form of faith. If that
      religion be true, there is but one savior, one inspired book, and but one
      little narrow grass-grown path that leads to heaven. Such a religion is
      necessarily uncompromising, unreasoning, aggressive and insolent.
      Christianity has held all other creeds and forms in infinite contempt,
      divided the world into enemies and friends, and verified the awful
      declaration of its founder—a declaration that wet with blood the
      sword he came to bring, and made the horizon of a thousand years lurid
      with the fagots' flames.
    </p>
<p>
      Too great praise challenges attention, and often brings to light a
      thousand faults that otherwise the general eye would never see. Were we
      allowed to read the Bible as we do all other books, we would admire its
      beauties, treasure its worthy thoughts, and account for all its absurd,
      grotesque and cruel things, by saying that its authors lived in rude,
      barbaric times. But we are told that it was written by inspired men; that
      it contains the will of God; that it is perfect, pure, and true in all its
      parts; the source and standard of all moral and religious truth; that it
      is the star and anchor of all human hope; the only guide for man, the only
      torch in Nature's night. These claims are so at variance with every known
      recorded fact, so palpably absurd, that every free unbiased soul is forced
      to raise the standard of revolt.
    </p>
<p>
      We read the pagan sacred books with profit and delight. With myth and
      fable we are ever charmed, and find a pleasure in the endless repetition
      of the beautiful, poetic, and absurd. We find, in all these records of the
      past, philosophies and dreams, and efforts stained with tears, of great
      and tender souls who tried to pierce the mystery of life and death, to
      answer the eternal questions of the Whence and Whither, and vainly sought
      to make, with bits of shattered glass, a mirror that would, in very truth,
      reflect the face and form of Nature's perfect self.
    </p>
<p>
      These myths were born of hopes, and fears, and tears, and smiles, and they
      were touched and colored by all there is of joy and grief between the rosy
      dawn of birth, and deaths sad night. They clothed even the stars with
      passion, and gave to gods the faults and frailties of the sons of men. In
      them, the winds and waves were music, and all the lakes, and streams, and
      springs,—the mountains, woods and perfumed dells were haunted by a
      thousand fairy forms. They thrilled the veins of Spring with tremulous
      desire; made tawny Summer's billowed breast the throne and home of love;
      filled Autumn's arms with sun-kissed grapes, and gathered sheaves; and
      pictured Winter as a weak old king who felt, like Lear upon his withered
      face, Cordelia's tears. These myths, though false, are beautiful, and have
      for many ages and in countless ways, enriched the heart and kindled
      thought. But if the world were taught that all these things are true and
      all inspired of God, and that eternal punishment will be the lot of him
      who dares deny or doubt, the sweetest myth of all the Fable World would
      lose its beauty, and become a scorned and hateful thing to every brave and
      thoughtful man.

<h2>
      SOME MISTAKES OF MOSES.
    </h2>
<p>
      HE WHO ENDEAVORS TO CONTROL THE MIND BY FORCE IS A TYRANT, AND HE WHO
      SUBMITS IS A SLAVE.
    </p>
<p>
      I.
    </p>
<p>
      I want to do what little I can to make my country truly free, to broaden
      the intellectual horizon of our people, to destroy the prejudices born of
      ignorance and fear, to do away with the blind worship of the ignoble past,
      with the idea that all the great and good are dead, that the living are
      totally depraved, that all pleasures are sins, that sighs and groans are
      alone pleasing to God, that thought is dangerous, that intellectual
      courage is a crime, that cowardice is a virtue, that a certain belief is
      necessary to secure salvation, that to carry a cross in this world will
      give us a palm in the next, and that we must allow some priest to be the
      pilot of our souls.
    </p>
<p>
      Until every soul is freely permitted to investigate every book, and creed,
      and dogma for itself, the world cannot be free. Mankind will be enslaved
      until there is mental grandeur enough to allow each man to have his
      thought and say. This earth will be a paradise when men can, upon all
      these questions differ, and yet grasp each other's hands as friends. It is
      amazing to me that a difference of opinion upon subjects that we know
      nothing with certainty about, should make us hate, persecute, and despise
      each other. Why a difference of opinion upon predestination, or the
      Trinity, should make people imprison and burn each other seems beyond the
      comprehension of man; and yet in all countries where Christians have
      existed, they have destroyed each other to the exact extent of their
      power. Why should a believer in God hate an atheist? Surely the atheist
      has not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
      entitled to all the rights of man. Would it not be far better to treat
      this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?
    </p>
<p>
      Christians tell me that they love their enemies, and yet all I ask is—not
      that they love their enemies, not that they love their friends even, but
      that they treat those who differ from them, with simple fairness.
    </p>
<p>
      We do not wish to be forgiven, but we wish Christians to so act that we
      will not have to forgive them.
    </p>
<p>
      If all will admit that all have an equal right to think, then the question
      is forever solved; but as long as organized and powerful churches,
      pretending to hold the keys of heaven and hell, denounce every person as
      an outcast and criminal who thinks for himself and denies their authority,
      the world will be filled with hatred and suffering. To hate man and
      worship God seems to be the sum of all the creeds.
    </p>
<p>
      That which has happened in most countries has happened in ours. When a
      religion is founded, the educated, the powerful—that is to say, the
      priests and nobles, tell the ignorant and superstitious—that is to
      say, the people, that the religion of their country was given to their
      fathers by God himself; that it is the only true religion; that all others
      were conceived in falsehood and brought forth in fraud, and that all who
      believe in the true religion will be happy forever, while all others will
      burn in hell. For the purpose of governing the people, that is to say, for
      the purpose of being supported by the people, the priests and nobles
      declare this religion to be sacred, and that whoever adds to, or takes
      from it, will be burned here by man, and hereafter by God. The result of
      this is, that the priests and nobles will not allow the people to change;
      and when, after a time, the priests, having intellectually advanced, wish
      to take a step in the direction of progress, the people will not allow
      them to change. At first, the rabble are enslaved by the priests, and
      afterwards the rabble become the masters.
    </p>
<p>
      One of the first things I wish to do, is to free the orthodox clergy. I am
      a great friend of theirs, and in spite of all they may say against me, I
      am going to do them a great and lasting service. Upon their necks are
      visible the marks of the collar, and upon their backs those of the lash.
      They are not allowed to read and think for themselves. They are taught
      like parrots, and the best are those who repeat, with the fewest mistakes,
      the sentences they have been taught. They sit like owls upon some dead
      limb of the tree of knowledge, and hoot the same old hoots that have been
      hooted for eighteen hundred years. Their congregations are not grand
      enough, nor sufficiently civilized, to be willing that the poor preachers
      shall think for themselves. They are not employed for that purpose.
      Investigation regarded as a dangerous experiment, and the ministers are
      warned that none of that kind of work will be tolerated. They are notified
      to stand by the old creed, and to avoid all original thought, as a mortal
      pestilence. Every minister is employed like an attorney—either for
      plaintiff or defendant,—and he is expected to be true to his client.
      If he changes his mind, he is regarded as a deserter, and denounced,
      hated, and slandered accordingly. Every orthodox clergyman agrees not to
      change. He contracts not to find new facts, and makes a bargain that he
      will deny them if he does. Such is the position of a Protestant minister
      in this nineteenth century. His condition excites my pity; and to better
      it, I am going to do what little I can.
    </p>
<p>
      Some of the clergy have the independence to break away, and the intellect
      to maintain themselves as free men, but the most are compelled to submit
      to the dictation of the orthodox, and the dead. They are not employed to
      give their thoughts, but simply to repeat the ideas of others. They are
      not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest themselves, but are
      required to walk in the narrow, verdureless path trodden by the ignorance
      of the past. The forests and fields on either side are nothing to them.
      They must not even look at the purple hills, nor pause to hear the babble
      of the brooks. They must remain in the dusty road where the guide-boards
      are. They must confine themselves to the "fall of man," the expulsion from
      the garden, the "scheme of salvation," the "second birth," the atonement,
      the happiness of the redeemed, and the misery of the lost. They must be
      careful not to express any new ideas upon these great questions. It is
      much safer for them to quote from the works of the dead. The more vividly
      they describe the sufferings of the unregenerate, of those who attended
      theatres and balls, and drank wine in summer gardens on the Sabbath-day,
      and laughed at priests, the better ministers they are supposed to be. They
      must show that misery fits the good for heaven, while happiness prepares
      the bad for hell; that the wicked get all their good things in this life,
      and the good all their evil; that in this world God punishes the people he
      loves, and in the next, the ones he hates; that happiness makes us bad
      here, but not in heaven; that pain makes us good here, but not in hell. No
      matter how absurd these things may appear to the carnal mind, they must be
      preached and they must be believed. If they were reasonable, there would
      be no virtue in believing. Even the publicans and sinners believe
      reasonable things. To believe without evidence, or in spite of it, is
      accounted as righteousness to the sincere and humble Christian.
    </p>
<p>
      The ministers are in duty bound to denounce all intellectual pride, and
      show that we are never quite so dear to God as when we admit that we are
      poor, corrupt and idiotic worms; that we never should have been born; that
      we ought to be damned without the least delay; that we are so infamous
      that we like to enjoy ourselves; that we love our wives and children
      better than our God; that we are generous only because we are vile; that
      we are honest from the meanest motives, and that sometimes we have fallen
      so low that we have had doubts about the inspiration of the Jewish
      Scriptures. In short, they are expected to denounce all pleasant paths and
      rustling trees, to curse the grass and flowers, and glorify the dust and
      weeds. They are expected to malign the wicked people in the green and
      happy fields, who sit and laugh beside the gurgling springs or climb the
      hills and wander as they will. They are expected to point out the dangers
      of freedom, the safety of implicit obedience, and to show the wickedness
      of philosophy, the goodness of faith, the immorality of science and the
      purity of ignorance.
    </p>
<p>
      Now and then a few pious people discover some young man of a religious
      turn of mind and a consumptive habit of body, not quite sickly enough to
      die, nor healthy enough to be wicked. The idea occurs to them that he
      would make a good orthodox minister. They take up a contribution, and send
      the young man to some theological school where he can be taught to repeat
      a creed and despise reason. Should it turn out that the young man had some
      mind of his own, and, after graduating, should change his opinions and
      preach a different doctrine from that taught in the school, every man who
      contributed a dollar towards his education would feel that he had been
      robbed, and would denounce him as a dishonest and ungrateful wretch.
    </p>
<p>
      The pulpit should not be a pillory. Congregations should allow the
      minister a little liberty. They should, at least, permit him to tell the
      truth.
    </p>
<p>
      They have, in Massachusetts, at a place called Andover, a kind of minister
      factory, where each professor takes an oath once in five years—that
      time being considered the life of an oath—that he has not, during
      the last five years, and will not, during the next five years,
      intellectually advance. There is probably no oath that they could easier
      keep. Probably, since the foundation stone of that institution was laid
      there has not been a single case of perjury. The old creed is still
      taught. They still insist that God is infinitely wise, powerful and good,
      and that all men are totally depraved. They insist that the best man God
      ever made, deserved to be damned the moment he was finished. Andover puts
      its brand upon every minister it turns out, the same as Sheffield and
      Birmingham brand their wares, and all who see the brand know exactly what
      the minister believes, the books he has read, the arguments he relies on,
      and just what he intellectually is. They know just what he can be depended
      on to preach, and that he will continue to shrink and shrivel, and grow
      solemnly stupid day by day until he reaches the Andover of the grave and
      becomes truly orthodox forever.
    </p>
<p>
      I have not singled out the Andover factory because it is worse than the
      others. They are all about the same. The professors, for the most part,
      are ministers who failed in the pulpit and were retired to the seminary on
      account of their deficiency in reason and their excess of faith. As a
      rule, they know nothing of this world, and far less of the next; but they
      have the power of stating the most absurd propositions with faces solemn
      as stupidity touched by fear.
    </p>
<p>
      Something should be done for the liberation of these men. They should be
      allowed to grow—to have sunlight and air. They should no longer be
      chained and tied to confessions of faith, to mouldy books and musty
      creeds. Thousands of ministers are anxious to give their honest thoughts.
      The hands of wives and babes now stop their mouths. They must have bread,
      and so the husbands and fathers are forced to preach a doctrine that they
      hold in scorn. For the sake of shelter, food and clothes, they are obliged
      to defend the childish miracles of the past, and denounce the sublime
      discoveries of to-day. They are compelled to attack all modern thought, to
      point out the dangers of science, the wickedness of investigation and the
      corrupting influence of logic. It is for them to show that virtue rests
      upon ignorance and faith, while vice impudently feeds and fattens upon
      fact and demonstration. It is a part of their business to malign and
      vilify the Voltaires, Humes, Paines, Humboldts, Tyndalls, Haeckels,
      Darwins, Spencers, and Drapers, and to bow with uncovered heads before the
      murderers, adulterers, and persecutors of the world. They are, for the
      most part, engaged in poisoning the minds of the young, prejudicing
      children against science, teaching the astronomy and geology of the Bible,
      and inducing all to desert the sublime standard of reason.
    </p>
<p>
      These orthodox ministers do not add to the sum of knowledge. They produce
      nothing. They live upon alms. They hate laughter and joy. They officiate
      at weddings, sprinkle water upon babes, and utter meaningless words and
      barren promises above the dead. They laugh at the agony of unbelievers,
      mock at their tears, and of their sorrows make a jest. There are some
      noble exceptions. Now and then a pulpit holds a brave and honest man.
      Their congregations are willing that they should think—willing that
      their ministers should have a little freedom.
    </p>
<p>
      As we become civilized, more and more liberty will be accorded to these
      men, until finally ministers will give their best and highest thoughts.
      The congregations will finally get tired of hearing about the patriarchs
      and saints, the miracles and wonders, and will insist upon knowing
      something about the men and women of our day, and the accomplishments and
      discoveries of our time. They will finally insist upon knowing how to
      escape the evils of this world instead of the next. They will ask light
      upon the enigmas of this life. They will wish to know what we shall do
      with our criminals instead of what God will do with his—how we shall
      do away with beggary and want—with crime and misery—with
      prostitution, disease and famine,—with tyranny in all its cruel
      forms—with prisons and scaffolds, and how we shall reward the honest
      workers, and fill the world with happy homes! These are the problems for
      the pulpits and congregations of an enlightened future. If Science cannot
      finally answer these questions, it is a vain and worthless thing.
    </p>
<p>
      The clergy, however, will continue to answer them in the old way, until
      their congregations are good enough to set them free. They will still talk
      about believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, as though that were the only
      remedy for all human ills. They will still teach that retrogression is the
      only path that leads to light; that we must go back, that faith is the
      only sure guide, and that reason is a delusive glare, lighting only the
      road to eternal pain.
    </p>
<p>
      Until the clergy are free they cannot be intellectually honest. We can
      never tell what they really believe until they know that they can safely
      speak. They console themselves now by a secret resolution to be as liberal
      as they dare, with the hope that they can finally educate their
      congregations to the point of allowing them to think a little for
      themselves. They hardly know what they ought to do. The best part of their
      lives has been wasted in studying subjects of no possible value. Most of
      them are married, have families, and know but one way of making their
      living. Some of them say that if they do not preach these foolish dogmas,
      others will, and that they may through fear, after all, restrain mankind.
      Besides, they hate publicly to admit that they are mistaken, that the
      whole thing is a delusion, that the "scheme of salvation" is absurd, and
      that the Bible is no better than some other books, and worse than most.
    </p>
<p>
      You can hardly expect a bishop to leave his palace, or the pope to vacate
      the Vatican. As long as people want popes, plenty of hypocrites will be
      found to take the place. And as long as labor fatigues, there will be
      found a good many men willing to preach once a week, if other folks will
      work and give them bread. In other words, while the demand lasts, the
      supply will never fail.
    </p>
<p>
      If the people were a little more ignorant, astrology would flourish—if
      a little more enlightened, religion would perish!
    </p>
<p>
      II. FREE SCHOOLS.
    </p>
<p>
      It is also my desire to free the schools. When a professor in a college
      finds a fact, he should make it known, even if it is inconsistent with
      something Moses said. Public opinion must not compel the professor to hide
      a fact, and, "like the base Indian, throw the pearl away." With the single
      exception of Cornell, there is not a college in the United States where
      truth has ever been a welcome guest. The moment one of the teachers denies
      the inspiration of the Bible, he is discharged. If he discovers a fact
      inconsistent with that book, so much the worse for the fact, and
      especially for the discoverer of the fact. He must not corrupt the minds
      of his pupils with demonstrations. He must beware of every truth that
      cannot, in some way be made to harmonize with the superstitions of the
      Jews. Science has nothing in common with religion. Facts and miracles
      never did, and never will agree. They are not in the least related. They
      are deadly foes. What has religion to do with facts? Nothing. Can there be
      Methodist mathematics, Catholic astronomy, Presbyterian geology, Baptist
      biology, or Episcopal botany? Why, then, should a sectarian college exist?
      Only that which somebody knows should be taught in our schools. We should
      not collect taxes to pay people for guessing. The common school is the
      bread of life for the people, and it should not be touched by the
      withering hand of superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      Our country will never be filled with great institutions of learning until
      there is an absolute divorce between Church and School. As long as the
      mutilated records of a barbarous people are placed by priest and professor
      above the reason of mankind, we shall reap but little benefit from church
      or school.
    </p>
<p>
      Instead of dismissing professors for finding something out, let us rather
      discharge those who do not. Let each teacher understand that investigation
      is not dangerous for him; that his bread is safe, no matter how much truth
      he may discover, and that his salary will not be reduced, simply because
      he finds that the ancient Jews did not know the entire history of the
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      Besides, it is not fair to make the Catholic support a Protestant school,
      nor is it just to collect taxes from infidels and atheists to support
      schools in which any system of religion is taught.
    </p>
<p>
      The sciences are not sectarian. People do not persecute each other on
      account of disagreements in mathematics. Families are not divided about
      botany, and astronomy does not even tend to make a man hate his father and
      mother. It is what people do not know, that they persecute each other
      about. Science will bring, not a sword, but peace.
    </p>
<p>
      Just as long as religion has control of the schools, science will be an
      outcast. Let us free our institutions of learning. Let us dedicate them to
      the science of eternal truth. Let us tell every teacher to ascertain all
      the facts he can—to give us light, to follow Nature, no matter where
      she leads; to be infinitely true to himself and us; to feel that he is
      without a chain, except the obligation to be honest; that he is bound by
      no books, by no creed, neither by the sayings of the dead nor of the
      living; that he is asked to look with his own eyes, to reason for himself
      without fear, to investigate in every possible direction, and to bring us
      the fruit of all his work.
    </p>
<p>
      At present, a good many men engaged in scientific pursuits, and who have
      signally failed in gaining recognition among their fellows, are
      endeavoring to make reputations among the churches by delivering weak and
      vapid lectures upon the "harmony of Genesis and Geology." Like all
      hypocrites, these men overstate the case to such a degree, and so turn and
      pervert facts and words that they succeed only in gaining the applause of
      other hypocrites like themselves. Among the great scientists they are
      regarded as generals regard sutlers who trade with both armies.
    </p>
<p>
      Surely the time must come when the wealth of the world will not be wasted
      in the propagation of ignorant creeds and miraculous mistakes. The time
      must come when churches and cathedrals will be dedicated to the use of
      man; when minister and priest will deem the discoveries of the living of
      more importance than the errors of the dead; when the truths of Nature
      will outrank the "sacred" falsehoods of the past, and when a single fact
      will outweigh all the miracles of Holy Writ.
    </p>
<p>
      Who can over estimate the progress of the world if all the money wasted in
      superstition could be used to enlighten, elevate and civilize mankind?
    </p>
<p>
      When every church becomes a school, every cathedral a university, every
      clergyman a teacher, and all their hearers brave and honest thinkers,
      then, and not until then, will the dream of poet, patriot, philanthropist
      and philosopher, become a real and blessed truth.
    </p>
<p>
      III. THE POLITICIANS.
    </p>
<p>
      I would like also to liberate the politician. At present, the successful
      office-seeker is a good deal like the centre of the earth; he weighs
      nothing himself, but draws everything else to him. There are so many
      societies, so many churches, so many isms, that it is almost impossible
      for an independent man to succeed in a political career. Candidates are
      forced to pretend that they are Catholics with Protestant proclivities, or
      Christians with liberal tendencies, or temperance men who now and then
      take a glass of wine, or, that although not members of any church their
      wives are, and that they subscribe liberally to all. The result of all
      this is that we reward hypocrisy and elect men entirely destitute of real
      principle; and this will never change until the people become grand enough
      to allow each other to do their own thinking, our Government should be
      entirely and purely secular. The religious views of a candidate should be
      kept entirely out of sight. He should not be compelled to give his opinion
      as to the inspiration of the Bible, the propriety of infant baptism, or
      the immaculate conception. All these things are private and personal. He
      should be allowed to settle such things for himself, and should he decide
      contrary to the law and will of God, let him settle the matter with God.
      The people ought to be wise enough to select as their officers men who
      know something of political affairs, who comprehend the present greatness,
      and clearly perceive the future grandeur of our country. If we were in a
      storm at sea, with deck wave-washed and masts strained and bent with
      storm, and it was necessary to reef the top sail, we certainly would not
      ask the brave sailor who volunteered to go aloft, what his opinion was on
      the five points of Calvinism. Our Government has nothing to do with
      religion. It is neither Christian nor pagan; it is secular. But as long as
      the people persist in voting for or against men on account of their
      religious views, just so long will hypocrisy hold place and power. Just so
      long will the candidates crawl in the dust—hide their opinions,
      flatter those with whom they differ, pretend to agree with those whom they
      despise; and just so long will honest men be trampled under foot. Churches
      are becoming political organizations. Nearly every Catholic is a Democrat;
      nearly every Methodist in the North is a Republican.
    </p>
<p>
      It probably will not be long until the churches will divide as sharply
      upon political, as upon theological questions; and when that day comes, if
      there are not liberals enough to hold the balance of power, this
      Government will be destroyed. The liberty of man is not safe in the hands
      of any church. Wherever the Bible and sword are in partnership, man is a
      slave.
    </p>
<p>
      All laws for the purpose of making man worship God, are born of the same
      spirit that kindled the fires of the <i>auto da fe</i>, and lovingly built
      the dungeons of the Inquisition. All laws defining and punishing blasphemy—making
      it a crime to give your honest ideas about the Bible, or to laugh at the
      ignorance of the ancient Jews, or to enjoy yourself on the Sabbath, or to
      give your opinion of Jehovah, were passed by impudent bigots, and should
      be at once repealed by honest men. An infinite God ought to be able to
      protect himself, without going in partnership with State Legislatures.
      Certainly he ought not so to act that laws become necessary to keep him
      from being laughed at. No one thinks of protecting Shakespeare from
      ridicule, by the threat of fine and imprisonment. It strikes me that God
      might write a book that would not necessarily excite the laughter of his
      children. In fact, I think it would be safe to say that a real God could
      produce a work that would excite the admiration of mankind. Surely
      politicians could be better employed than in passing laws to protect the
      literary reputation of the Jewish God.
    </p>
<p>
      IV. MAN AND WOMAN
    </p>
<p>
      Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists,
    </p>
<p>
      Catholics, Presbyterians, or Freethinkers, and remember only that we are
      men and women. After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.
      All other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
      given up our individuality, and have consented to wear the collar of
      authority—that we are followers. Throwing away these names, let us
      examine these questions not as partisans, but as human beings with hopes
      and fears in common.
    </p>
<p>
      We know that our opinions depend, to a great degree, upon our surroundings—upon
      race, country, and education. We are all the result of numberless
      conditions, and inherit vices and virtues, truths and prejudices. If we
      had been born in England, surrounded by wealth and clothed with power,
      most of us would have been Episcopalians, and believed in church and
      state. We should have insisted that the people needed a religion, and that
      not having intellect enough to provide one for themselves, it was our duty
      to make one for them, and then compel them to support it. We should have
      believed it indecent to officiate in a pulpit without wearing a gown, and
      that prayers should be read from a book. Had we belonged to the lower
      classes, we might have been dissenters and protested against the mummeries
      of the High Church. Had we been born in Turkey, most of us would have been
      Mohammedans and believed in the inspiration of the Koran. We should have
      believed that Mohammed actually visited heaven and became acquainted with
      an angel by the name of Gabriel, who was so broad between the eyes that it
      required three hundred days for a very smart camel to travel the distance.
      If some man had denied this story we should probably have denounced him as
      a dangerous person, one who was endeavoring to undermine the foundations
      of society, and to destroy all distinction between virtue and vice. We
      should have said to him, "What do you propose to give us in place of that
      angel? We cannot afford to give up an angel of that size for nothing." We
      would have insisted that the best and wisest men believed the Koran. We
      would have quoted from the works and letters of philosophers, generals and
      sultans, to show that the Koran was the best of books, and that Turkey was
      indebted to that book and to that alone for its greatness and prosperity.
      We would have asked that man whether he knew more than all the great minds
      of his country, whether he was so much wiser than his fathers? We would
      have pointed out to him the fact that thousands had been consoled in the
      hour of death by passages from the Koran; that they had died with glazed
      eyes brightened by visions of the heavenly harem, and gladly left this
      world of grief and tears. We would have regarded Christians as the vilest
      of men, and on all occasions would have repeated "There is but one God,
      and Mohammed is his prophet!"
    </p>
<p>
      So, if we had been born in India, we should in all probability have
      believed in the religion of that country. We should have regarded the old
      records as true and sacred, and looked upon a wandering priest as better
      than the men from whom he begged, and by whose labor he lived. We should
      have believed in a god with three heads instead of three gods with one
      head, as we do now.
    </p>
<p>
      Now and then some one says that the religion of his father and mother is
      good enough for him, and wonders why anybody should desire a better.
      Surely we are not bound to follow our parents in religion any more than in
      politics, science or art. China has been petrified by the worship of
      ancestors. If our parents had been satisfied with the religion of theirs,
      we would be still less advanced than we are. If we are, in any way, bound
      by the belief of our fathers, the doctrine will hold good back to the
      first people who had a religion; and if this doctrine is true, we ought
      now to be believers in that first religion. In other words, we would all
      be barbarians. You cannot show real respect to your parents by
      perpetuating their errors. Good fathers and mothers wish their children to
      advance, to overcome obstacles which baffled them, and to correct the
      errors of their education. If you wish to reflect credit upon your
      parents, accomplish more than they did, solve problems that they could not
      understand, and build better than they knew. To sacrifice your manhood
      upon the grave of your father is an honor to neither. Why should a son who
      has examined a subject, throw away his reason and adopt the views of his
      mother? Is not such a course dishonorable to both?
    </p>
<p>
      We must remember that this "ancestor" argument is as old at least as the
      second generation of men, that it has served no purpose except to enslave
      mankind, and results mostly from the fact that acquiescence is easier than
      investigation. This argument pushed to its logical conclusion, would
      prevent the advance of all people whose parents were not Freethinkers.
    </p>
<p>
      It is hard for many people to give up the religion in which they were
      born; to admit that their fathers were utterly mistaken, and that the
      sacred records of their country are but collections of myths and fables.
    </p>
<p>
      But when we look for a moment at the world, we find that each nation has
      its "sacred records"—its religion, and its ideas of worship.
      Certainly all cannot be right; and as it would require a life time to
      investigate the claims of these various systems, it is hardly fair to damn
      a man forever, simply because he happens to believe the wrong one. All
      these religions were produced by barbarians. Civilized nations have
      contented themselves with changing the religions of their barbaric
      ancestors, but they have made none. Nearly all these religions are
      intensely selfish. Each one was made by some contemptible little nation
      that regarded itself as of almost infinite importance, and looked upon the
      other nations as beneath the notice of their god. In all these countries
      it was a crime to deny the sacred records, to laugh at the priests, to
      speak disrespectfully of the gods, to fail to divide your substance with
      the lazy hypocrites who managed your affairs in the next world upon
      condition that you would support them in this. In the olden time these
      theological people who quartered themselves upon the honest and
      industrious, were called soothsayers, seers, charmers, prophets,
      enchanters, sorcerers, wizards, astrologers, and impostors, but now, they
      are known as clergymen.
    </p>
<p>
      We are no exception to the general rule, and consequently have our sacred
      books as well as the rest. Of course, it is claimed by many of our people
      that our books are the only true ones, the only ones that the real God
      ever wrote, or had anything whatever to do with. They insist that all
      other sacred books were written by hypocrites and impostors; that the Jews
      were the only people that God ever had any personal intercourse with, and
      that all other prophets and seers were inspired only by impudence and
      mendacity. True, it seems somewhat strange that God should have chosen a
      barbarous and unknown people who had little or nothing to do with the
      other nations of the earth, as his messengers to the rest of mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not easy to account for an infinite God making people so low in the
      scale of intellect as to require a revelation. Neither is it easy to
      perceive why, if a revelation was necessary for all, it was made only to a
      few. Of course, I know that it is extremely wicked to suggest these
      thoughts, and that ignorance is the only armor that can effectually
      protect you from the wrath of God. I am aware that investigators with all
      their genius, never find the road to heaven; that those who look where
      they are going are sure to miss it, and that only those who voluntarily
      put out their eyes and implicitly depend upon blindness can surely keep
      the narrow path.
    </p>
<p>
      Whoever reads our sacred book is compelled to believe it or suffer forever
      the torments of the lost. We are told that we have the privilege of
      examining it for ourselves; but this privilege is only extended to us on
      the condition that we believe it whether it appears reasonable or not. We
      may disagree with others as much as we please upon the meaning of all
      passages in the Bible, but we must not deny the truth of a single word. We
      must believe that the book is inspired. If we obey its every precept
      without believing in its inspiration we will be damned just as certainly
      as though we disobeyed its every word. We have no right to weigh it in the
      scales of reason—to test it by the laws of nature, or the facts of
      observation and experience. To do this, we are told, is to put ourselves
      above the word of God, and sit in judgment on the works of our creator.
    </p>
<p>
      For my part, I cannot admit that belief is a voluntary thing. It seems to
      me that evidence, even in spite of ourselves, will have its weight, and
      that whatever our wish may be, we are compelled to stand with fairness by
      the scales, and give the exact result. It will not do to say that we
      reject the Bible because we are wicked. Our wickedness must be ascertained
      not from our belief but from our acts.
    </p>
<p>
      I am told by the clergy that I ought not to attack the Bible; that I am
      leading thousands to perdition and rendering certain the damnation of my
      own soul. They have had the kindness to advise me that, if my object is to
      make converts, I am pursuing the wrong course. They tell me to use gentler
      expressions, and more cunning words. Do they really wish me to make more
      converts? If their advice is honest, they are traitors to their trust. If
      their advice is not honest, then they are unfair with me. Certainly they
      should wish me to pursue the course that will make the fewest converts,
      and yet they pretend to tell me how my influence could be increased. It
      may be, that upon this principle John Bright advises America to adopt free
      trade, so that our country can become a successful rival of Great Britain.
      Sometimes I think that even ministers are not entirely candid.
    </p>
<p>
      Notwithstanding the advice of the clergy, I have concluded to pursue my
      own course, to tell my honest thoughts, and to have my freedom in this
      world whatever my fate may be in the next.
    </p>
<p>
      The real oppressor, enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible.
      That book is the chain that binds, the dungeon that holds the clergy. That
      book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and schools. That
      book puts out the eyes of science, and makes honest investigation a crime.
      That book unmans the politician and degrades the people. That book fills
      the world with bigotry, hypocrisy and fear. It plays the same part in our
      country that has been played by "sacred records" in all the nations of the
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      A little while ago I saw one of the Bibles of the Middle Ages. It was
      about two feet in length, and one and a half in width. It had immense
      oaken covers, with hasps, and clasps, and hinges large enough almost for
      the doors of a penitentiary. It was covered with pictures of winged angels
      and aureoled saints. In my imagination I saw this book carried to the
      cathedral altar in solemn pomp—heard the chant of robed and kneeling
      priests, felt the strange tremor of the organ's peal; saw the colored
      light streaming through windows stained and touched by blood and flame—the
      swinging censer with its perfumed incense rising to the mighty roof, dim
      with height and rich with legend carved in stone, while on the walls was
      hung, written in light, and shade, and all the colors that can tell of joy
      and tears, the pictured history of the martyred Christ. The people fell
      upon their knees. The book was opened, and the priest read the messages
      from God to man. To the multitude, the book itself was evidence enough
      that it was not the work of human hands. How could those little marks and
      lines and dots contain, like tombs, the thoughts of men, and how could
      they, touched by a ray of light from human eyes, give up their dead? How
      could these characters span the vast chasm dividing the present from the
      past, and make it possible for the living still to hear the voices of the
      dead?
    </p>
<p>
      V. THE PENTATEUCH
    </p>
<p>
      The first five books in our Bible are known as the Pentateuch. For a long
      time it was supposed that Moses was the author, and among the ignorant the
      supposition still prevails. As a matter of fact, it seems to be well
      settled that Moses had nothing to do with these books, and that they were
      not written until he had been dust and ashes for hundreds of years. But,
      as all the churches still insist that he was the author, that he wrote
      even an account of his own death and burial, let us speak of him as though
      these books were in fact written by him. As the Christians maintain that
      God was the real author, it makes but little difference whom he employed
      as his pen.
    </p>
<p>
      Nearly all authors of sacred books have given an account of the creation
      of the universe, the origin of matter, and the destiny of the human race,
      all have pointed out the obligation that man is under to his creator for
      having placed him upon the earth, and allowed him to live and suffer, and
      have taught that nothing short of the most abject worship could possibly
      compensate God for his trouble and labor suffered and done for the good of
      man. They have nearly all insisted that we should thank God for all that
      is good in life; but they have not all informed us as to whom we should
      hold responsible for the evils we endure.
    </p>
<p>
      Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure to
      say anything of a future life, by failing to promise heaven, and to
      threaten hell. Upon the subject of a future state, there is not one word
      in the Pentateuch. Probably at that early day God did not deem it
      important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man. He seems
      to have thought that he could control the Jews, at least, by rewards and
      punishments in this world, and so he kept the frightful realities of
      eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people of his choice.
      He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their origin than to
      enlighten them as to their destiny.
    </p>
<p>
      We must remember that every tribe and nation has some way in which, the
      more striking phenomena of nature are accounted for. These accounts are
      handed down by tradition, changed by numberless narrators as intelligence
      increases, or to account for newly discovered facts, or for the purpose of
      satisfying the appetite for the marvelous.
    </p>
<p>
      The way in which a tribe or nation accounts for day and night, the change
      of seasons, the fall of snow and rain, the flight of birds, the origin of
      the rainbow, the peculiarities of animals, the dreams of sleep, the
      visions of the insane, the existence of earthquakes, volcanoes, storms,
      lightning and the thousand things that attract the attention and excite
      the wonder, fear or admiration of mankind, may be called the philosophy of
      that tribe or nation. And as all phenomena are, by savage and barbaric man
      accounted for as the action of intelligent beings for the accomplishment
      of certain objects, and as these beings were supposed to have the power to
      assist or injure man, certain things were supposed necessary for man to do
      in order to gain the assistance, and avoid the anger of these gods. Out of
      this belief grew certain ceremonies, and these ceremonies united with the
      belief, formed religion; and consequently every religion has for its
      foundation a misconception of the cause of phenomena.
    </p>
<p>
      All worship is necessarily based upon the belief that some being exists
      who can, if he will, change the natural order of events. The savage prays
      to a stone that he calls a god, while the Christian prays to a god that he
      calls a spirit, and the prayers of both are equally useful. The savage and
      the Christian put behind the Universe an intelligent cause, and this cause
      whether represented by one god or many, has been, in all ages, the object
      of all worship. To carry a fetich, to utter a prayer, to count beads, to
      abstain from food, to sacrifice a lamb, a child or an enemy, are simply
      different ways by which the accomplishment of the same object is sought,
      and are all the offspring of the same error.
    </p>
<p>
      Many systems of religion must have existed many ages before the art of
      writing was discovered, and must have passed through many changes before
      the stories, miracles, histories, prophecies and mistakes became fixed and
      petrified in written words. After that, change was possible only by giving
      new meanings to old words, a process rendered necessary by the continual
      acquisition of facts somewhat inconsistent with a literal interpretation
      of the "sacred records." In this way an honest faith often prolongs its
      life by dishonest methods; and in this way the Christians of to-day are
      trying to harmonize the Mosaic account of creation with the theories and
      discoveries of modern science.
    </p>
<p>
      Admitting that Moses was the author of the Pentateuch, or that he gave to
      the Jews a religion, the question arises as to where he obtained his
      information. We are told by the theologians that he received his knowledge
      from God, and that every word he wrote was and is the exact truth. It is
      admitted at the same time that he was an adopted son of Pharaoh's
      daughter, and enjoyed the rank and privilege of a prince. Under such
      circumstances, he must have been well acquainted with the literature,
      philosophy and religion of the Egyptians, and must have known what they
      believed and taught as to the creation of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, if the account of the origin of this earth as given by Moses is
      substantially like that given by the Egyptians, then we must conclude that
      he learned it from them. Should we imagine that he was divinely inspired
      because he gave to the Jews what the Egyptians had given him?
    </p>
<p>
      The Egyptian priests taught <i>first</i>, that a god created the original
      matter, leaving it in a state of chaos; <i>second</i>, that a god moulded
      it into form; <i>third</i>, that the breath of a god moved upon the face
      of the deep; <i>fourth</i>, that a god created simply by saying "Let it
      be;" <i>fifth</i>, that a god created light before the sun existed.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the
      principal parts of his narrative, making such changes and additions as
      were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people.
    </p>
<p>
      If some man at the present day should assert that he had received from God
      the theories of evolution, the survival of the fittest, and the law of
      heredity, and we should afterwards find that he was not only an
      Englishman, but had lived in the family of Charles Darwin, we certainly
      would account for his having these theories in a natural way, So, if
      Darwin himself should pretend that he was inspired, and had obtained his
      peculiar theories from God, we should probably reply that his grandfather
      suggested the same ideas, and that Lamarck published substantially the
      same theories the same year that Mr. Darwin was born.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, if we have sufficient courage, we will, by the same course of
      reasoning, account for the story of creation found in the Bible. We will
      say that it contains the belief of Moses, and that he received his
      information from the Egyptians, and not from God. If we take the account
      as the absolute truth and use it for the purpose of determining the value
      of modern thought, scientific advancement becomes impossible. And even if
      the account of the creation as given by Moses should turn out to be true,
      and should be so admitted by all the scientific world, the claim that he
      was inspired would still be without the least particle of proof. We would
      be forced to admit that he knew more than we had supposed. It certainly is
      no proof that a man is inspired simply because he is right.
    </p>
<p>
      No one pretends that Shakespeare was inspired, and yet all the writers of
      the books of the Old Testament put together, could not have produced
      Hamlet.
    </p>
<p>
      Why should we, looking upon some rough and awkward thing, or god in stone,
      say that it must have been produced by some inspired sculptor, and with
      the same breath pronounce the <i>Venus de Milo</i> to be the work of man?
      Why should we, looking at some ancient daub of angel, saint or virgin, say
      its painter must have been assisted by a god?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us account for all we see by the facts we know. If there are things
      for which we cannot account, let us wait for light. To account for
      anything by supernatural agencies is, in fact to say that we do not know.
      Theology is not what we know about God, but what we do not know about
      Nature. In order to increase our respect for the Bible, it became
      necessary for the priests to exalt and extol that book, and at the same
      time to decry and belittle the reasoning powers of man. The whole power of
      the pulpit has been used for hundreds of years to destroy the confidence
      of man in himself—to induce him to distrust his own powers of
      thought, to believe that he was wholly unable to decide any question for
      himself, and that all human virtue consists in faith and obedience. The
      church has said, "Believe, and obey! If you reason, you will become an
      unbeliever, and unbelievers will be lost. If you disobey, you will do so
      through vain pride and curiosity, and will, like Adam and Eve, be thrust
      from Paradise forever!"
    </p>
<p>
      For my part, I care nothing for what the church says, except in so far as
      it accords with my reason; and the Bible is nothing to me, only in so far
      as it agrees with what I think or know.
    </p>
<p>
      All books should be examined in the same spirit, and truth should be
      welcomed and falsehood exposed, no matter in what volume they may be
      found.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us in this spirit examine the Pentateuch; and if anything appears
      unreasonable, contradictory or absurd, let us have the honesty and courage
      to admit it. Certainly no good can result either from deceiving ourselves
      or others. Many millions have implicitly believed this book, and have just
      as implicitly believed that polygamy was sanctioned by God. Millions have
      regarded this book as the foundation of all human progress, and at the
      same time looked upon slavery as a divine institution. Millions have
      declared this book to have been infinitely holy, and to prove that they
      were right, have imprisoned, robbed and burned their fellow-men. The
      inspiration of this book has been established by famine, sword and fire,
      by dungeon, chain and whip, by dagger and by rack, by force and fear and
      fraud, and generations have been frightened by threats of hell, and bribed
      with promises of heaven.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us examine a portion of this book, not in the darkness of our fear,
      but in the light of reason.
    </p>
<p>
      And first, let us examine the account given of the creation of this world,
      commenced, according to the Bible, on Monday morning about five thousand
      eight hundred and eighty-three years ago.
    </p>
<p>
      VI. MONDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      Moses commences his story by telling us that in the beginning God created
      the heaven and the earth.
    </p>
<p>
      If this means anything, it means that God produced, caused to exist,
      called into being, the heaven and the earth. It will not do to say that he
      formed the heaven and the earth of previously existing matter. Moses
      conveys, and intended to convey the idea that the matter of which the
      heaven and the earth are composed, was created.
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created from
      nothing. Nothing, regarded in the light of a raw material, is a decided
      failure. I cannot conceive of matter apart from force. Neither is it
      possible to think of force disconnected with matter. You cannot imagine
      matter going back to absolute nothing. Neither can you imagine nothing
      being changed into something. You may be eternally damned if you do not
      say that you can conceive these things, but you cannot conceive them.
    </p>
<p>
      Such is the constitution of the human mind that it cannot even think of a
      commencement or an end of matter, or force.
    </p>
<p>
      If God created the universe, there was a time when he commenced to create.
      Back of that commencement there must have been an eternity. In that
      eternity what was this God doing? He certainly did not think. There was
      nothing to think about. He did not remember. Nothing had ever happened.
      What did he do? Can you imagine anything more absurd than an infinite
      intelligence in infinite nothing wasting an eternity?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not pretend to tell how all these things really are; but I do insist
      that a statement that cannot possibly be comprehended by any human being,
      and that appears utterly impossible, repugnant to every fact of
      experience, and contrary to everything that we really know, must be
      rejected by every honest man.
    </p>
<p>
      We can conceive of eternity, because we cannot conceive of a cessation of
      time. We can conceive of infinite space because we cannot conceive of so
      much matter that our imagination will not stand upon the farthest star,
      and see infinite space beyond. In other words, we cannot conceive of a
      cessation of time; therefore eternity is a necessity of the mind. Eternity
      sustains the same relation to time that space does to matter.
    </p>
<p>
      In the time of Moses, it was perfectly safe for him to write an account of
      the creation of the world. He had simply to put in form the crude notions
      of the people. At that time, no other Jew could have written a better
      account. Upon that subject he felt at liberty to give his imagination full
      play. There was no one who could authoritatively contradict anything he
      might say. It was substantially the same story that had been imprinted in
      curious characters upon the clay records of Babylon, the gigantic
      monuments of Egypt, and the gloomy temples of India. In those days there
      was an almost infinite difference between the educated and ignorant. The
      people were controlled almost entirely by signs and wonders. By the lever
      of fear, priests moved the world. The sacred records were made and kept,
      and altered by them. The people could not read, and looked upon one who
      could, as almost a god. In our day it is hard to conceive of the influence
      of an educated class in a barbarous age. It was only necessary to produce
      the "sacred record," and ignorance fell upon its face. The people were
      taught that the record was inspired, and therefore true. They were not
      taught that it was true, and therefore inspired.
    </p>
<p>
      After all, the real question is not whether the Bible is inspired, but
      whether it is true. If it is true, it does not need to be inspired. If it
      is true, it makes no difference whether it was written by a man or a god.
      The multiplication table is just as useful, just as true as though God had
      arranged the figures himself. If the Bible is really true, the claim of
      inspiration need not be urged; and if it is not true, its inspiration can
      hardly be established. As a matter of fact, the truth does not need to be
      inspired. Nothing needs inspiration except a falsehood or a mistake. Where
      truth ends, where probability stops, inspiration begins. A fact never went
      into partnership with a miracle. Truth does not need the assistance of
      miracle. A fact will fit every other fact in the Universe, because it is
      the product of all other facts. A lie will fit nothing except another lie
      made for the express purpose of fitting it. After a while the man gets
      tired of lying, and then the last lie will not fit the next fact, and then
      there is an opportunity to use a miracle. Just at that point, it is
      necessary to have a little inspiration.
    </p>
<p>
      It seems to me that reason is the highest attribute of man, and that if
      there can be any communication from God to man, it must be addressed to
      his reason. It does not seem possible that in order to understand a
      message from God it is absolutely essential to throw our reason away. How
      could God make known his will to any being destitute of reason? How can
      any man accept as a revelation from God that which is unreasonable to him?
      God cannot make a revelation to another man for me. He must make it to me,
      and until he convinces my reason that it is true, I cannot receive it.
    </p>
<p>
      The statement that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,
      I cannot accept. It is contrary to my reason, and I cannot believe it. It
      appears reasonable to me that force has existed from eternity. Force
      cannot, as it appears to me, exist apart from matter. Force, in its
      nature, is forever active, and without matter it could not act; and so I
      think matter must have existed forever. To conceive of matter without
      force, or of force without matter, or of a time when neither existed, or
      of a being who existed for an eternity without either, and who out of
      nothing created both, is to me utterly impossible. I may be damned on this
      account, but I cannot help it. In my judgment, Moses was mistaken.
    </p>
<p>
      It will not do to say that Moses merely intended to tell what God did, in
      making the heavens and the earth out of matter then in existence. He
      distinctly states that in the <i>beginning</i> God created them. If this
      account is true, we must believe that God, existing in infinite space
      surrounded by eternal nothing, naught and void, created, produced, called
      into being, willed into existence this universe of countless stars.
    </p>
<p>
      The next thing we are told by this inspired gentleman is, that God created
      light, and proceeded to divide it from the darkness.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, the person who wrote this believed that darkness was a thing,
      an entity, a material that could get mixed and tangled up with light, and
      that these entities, light and darkness, had to be separated. In his
      imagination he probably saw God throwing pieces and chunks of darkness on
      one side, and rays and beams of light on the other. It is hard for a man
      who has been born but once to understand these things. For my part, I
      cannot understand how light can be separated from darkness. I had always
      supposed that darkness was simply the absence of light, and that under no
      circumstances could it be necessary to take the darkness away from the
      light. It is certain, however, that Moses believed darkness to be a form
      of matter, because I find that in another place he speaks of a darkness
      that could be felt. They used to have on exhibition at Rome a bottle of
      the darkness that overspread Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      You cannot divide light from darkness any more than you can divide heat
      from cold. Cold is an absence of heat, and darkness is an absence of
      light. I suppose that we have no conception of absolute cold. We know only
      degrees of heat. Twenty degrees below zero is just twenty degrees warmer
      than forty degrees below zero. Neither cold nor darkness are entities, and
      these words express simply either the absolute or partial absence of heat
      or light. I cannot conceive how light can be divided from darkness, but I
      can conceive how a barbarian several thousand years ago, writing upon a
      subject about which he knew nothing, could make a mistake. The creator of
      light could not have written in this way. If such a being exists, he must
      have known the nature of that "mode of motion" that paints the earth on
      every eye, and clothes in garments seven-hued this universe of worlds.
    </p>
<p>
      VII. TUESDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      We are next informed by Moses that "God of the waters, and let it divide
      the waters from the waters;" and that "God made the firmament, and divided
      the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above
      the firmament." What did the writer mean by the word firmament?
      Theologians now tell us that he meant an "expanse." This will not do. How
      could an expanse divide the waters from the waters, so that the waters
      above the expanse would not fall into and mingle with the waters below the
      expanse? The truth is that Moses regarded the firmament as a solid affair.
      It was where God lived, and where water was kept. It was for this reason
      that they used to pray for rain. They supposed that some angel could with
      a lever raise a gate and let out the quantity of moisture desired. It was
      with the water from this firmament that the world was drowned when the
      windows of heaven were opened. It was in this said Let there be a
      firmament in the midst firmament that the sons of God lived—the sons
      who "saw the daughters of men that they were fair and took them wives of
      all which they chose." The issue of such marriages were giants, and "the
      same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown."
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing is clearer than that Moses regarded the firmament as a vast
      material division that separated the waters of the world, and upon whose
      floor God lived, surrounded by his sons. In no other way could he account
      for rain. Where did the water come from? He knew nothing about the laws of
      evaporation. He did not know that the sun wooed with amorous kisses the
      waves of the sea, and that they, clad in glorified mist rising to meet
      their lover, were, by disappointment, changed to tears and fell as rain.
    </p>
<p>
      The idea that the firmament was the abode of the Deity must have been in
      the mind of Moses when he related the dream of Jacob. "And he dreamed, and
      behold, a ladder set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven;
      and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it; and behold
      the Lord stood above it and said, I am the Lord God."
    </p>
<p>
      So, when the people were building the tower of Babel "the Lord came down
      to see the city, and the tower which the children of men builded. And the
      Lord said, Behold the people is one, and they have all one language: and
      this they begin to do; and nothing will be restrained from them which they
      imagined to do. Go to, let us go down and confound their language that
      they may not understand one another's speech."
    </p>
<p>
      The man who wrote that absurd account must have believed that God lived
      above the earth, in the firmament. The same idea was in the mind of the
      Psalmist when he said that God "bowed the heavens and came down."
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, God could easily remove any person bodily to heaven, as it was
      but a little way above the earth. "Enoch walked with God, and he was not,
      for God took him." The accounts in the Bible of the ascension of Elijah,
      Christ and St. Paul were born of the belief that the firmament was the
      dwelling-place of God. It probably never occurred to these writers that if
      the firmament was seven or eight miles away, Enoch and the rest would have
      been frozen perfectly stiff long before the journey could have been
      completed. Possibly Elijah might have made the voyage, as he was carried
      to heaven in a chariot of fire "by a whirlwind."
    </p>
<p>
      The truth is, that Moses was mistaken, and upon that mistake the
      Christians located their heaven and their hell. The telescope destroyed
      the firmament, did away with the heaven of the New Testament, rendered the
      ascension of our Lord and the assumption of his Mother infinitely absurd,
      crumbled to chaos the gates and palaces of the New Jerusalem, and in their
      places gave to man a wilderness of worlds.
    </p>
<p>
      VIII. WEDNESDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      We are next informed by the historian of creation, that after God had
      finished making the firmament and had succeeded in dividing the waters by
      means of an "expanse," he proceeded "to gather the waters on the earth
      together in seas, so that the dry land might appear."
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly the writer of this did not have any conception of the real form
      of the earth. He could not have known anything of the attraction of
      gravitation. He must have regarded the earth as flat and supposed that it
      required considerable force and power to induce the water to leave the
      mountains and collect in the valleys. Just as soon as the water was forced
      to run down hill, the dry land appeared, and the grass began to grow, and
      the mantles of green were thrown over the shoulders of the hills, and the
      trees laughed into bud and blossom, and the branches were laden with
      fruit. And all this happened before a ray had left the quiver of the sun,
      before a glittering beam had thrilled the bosom of a flower, and before
      the Dawn with trembling hands had drawn aside the curtains of the East and
      welcomed to her arms the eager god of Day.
    </p>
<p>
      It does not seem to me that grass and trees could grow and ripen into seed
      and fruit without the sun. According to the account, this all happened on
      the third day. Now, if, as the Christians say, Moses did not mean by the
      word day a period of twenty-four hours, but an immense and almost
      measureless space of time, and as God did not, according to this view make
      any animals until the fifth day, that is, not for millions of years after
      he made the grass and trees, for what purpose did he cause the trees to
      bear fruit?
    </p>
<p>
      Moses says that God said on the third day, "Let the earth bring forth
      grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
      kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth; and it was so. And the earth
      brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree
      yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind; and God saw that
      it was good, and the evening and the morning were the third day."
    </p>
<p>
      There was nothing to eat this fruit; not an insect with painted wings
      sought the honey of the flowers; not a single living, breathing thing upon
      the earth. Plenty of grass, a great variety of herbs, an abundance of
      fruit, but not a mouth in all the world. If Moses is right, this state of
      things lasted only two days; but if the modern theologians are correct, it
      continued for millions of ages.
    </p>
<p>
      "It is now well known that the organic history of the earth can be
      properly divided into five epochs—the Primordial, Primary,
      Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each of these epochs is characterized
      by animal and vegetable life peculiar to itself. In the First will be
      found Algæ and Skulless Vertebrates, in the Second, Ferns and
      Fishes, in the Third, Pine Forests and Reptiles, in the Fourth, Foliaceous
      Forests and Mammals, and in the Fifth, Man."
    </p>
<p>
      How much more reasonable this is than the idea that the earth was covered
      with grass, and herbs, and trees loaded with fruit for millions of years
      before an animal existed.
    </p>
<p>
      There is, in Nature, an even balance forever kept between the total
      amounts of animal and vegetable life. "In her wonderful economy she must
      form and bountifully nourish her vegetable progeny—twin-brother life
      to her, with that of animals. The perfect balance between plant existences
      and animal existences must always be maintained, while matter courses
      through the eternal circle, becoming each in turn. If an animal be
      resolved into its ultimate constituents in a period according to the
      surrounding circumstances, say, of four hours, of four months, of four
      years, or even of four thousand years,—for it is impossible to deny
      that there may be instances of all these periods during which the process
      has continued—those elements which assume the gaseous form mingle at
      once with the atmosphere and are taken up from it without delay by the
      ever-open mouths of vegetable life. By a thousand pores in every leaf the
      carbonic acid which renders the atmosphere unfit for animal life is
      absorbed, the carbon being separated, and assimilated to form the
      vegetable fibre, which, as wood, makes and furnishes our houses and ships,
      is burned for our warmth, or is stored up under pressure for coal. All
      this carbon has played its part, and many parts in its time, as animal
      existences from monad up to man. Our mahogany of to-day has been many
      negroes in its turn, and before the African existed, was integral portions
      of many a generation of extinct species."
    </p>
<p>
      It seems reasonable to suppose that certain kinds of vegetation-and
      certain kinds of animals should exist together, and that as the character
      of the vegetation changed, a corresponding change would take place in the
      animal world. It may be that I am led to these conclusions by "total
      depravity," or that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to
      satisfactorily harmonize Haeckel and Moses; or that I am carried away by
      pride, blinded by reason, given over to hardness of heart that I might be
      damned, but I never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves,
      and buds, and flowers, and fruits before the sun with glittering spear had
      driven back the hosts of Night.
    </p>
<p>
      IX. THURSDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      After the world was covered with vegetation, it occurred to Moses that it
      was about time to make a sun and moon; and so we are told that on the
      fourth day God said, "Let there be light in the firmament of the heaven to
      divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons,
      and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the
      heaven to give light upon the earth; and it was so. And God made two great
      lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule
      the night; he made the stars also."
    </p>
<p>
      Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the
      sun? Draw a circle five inches in diameter, and by its side thrust a pin
      through the paper. The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same
      relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun. Did he know that
      the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter; that it
      was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth, hotter even
      than the Christian's hell, over which sweep tempests of flame moving at
      the rate of one hundred miles a second, compared with which the wildest
      storm that ever wrecked the forests of this world was but a calm? Did he
      know that the sun every moment of time throws out as much heat as could be
      generated by the combustion of millions upon millions of tons of coal? Did
      he know that the volume of the earth is less than one-millionth of that of
      the sun? Did he know of the one hundred and four planets belonging to our
      solar system, all children of the sun? Did he know of Jupiter eighty-five
      thousand miles in diameter, hundreds of times as large as our earth,
      turning on his axis at the rate of twenty-five thousand miles an hour
      accompanied by four moons, making the tour of his orbit in fifty years, a
      distance of three thousand million miles? Did he know anything about
      Saturn, his rings and his eight moons? Did he have the faintest idea that
      all these planets were once a part of the sun; that the vast luminary was
      once thousands of millions of miles in diameter; that Neptune, Uranus,
      Saturn, Jupiter and Mars were all born before our earth, and that by no
      possibility could this world have existed three days, nor three periods,
      nor three "good whiles" before its source, the sun?
    </p>
<p>
      Moses supposed the sun to be about three or four feet in diameter and the
      moon about half that size. Compared with the earth they were but simple
      specks. This idea seems to have been shared by all the "inspired" men. We
      find in the book of Joshua that the sun stood still, and the moon stayed
      until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. "So the sun
      stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a
      whole day."
    </p>
<p>
      We are told that the sacred writer wrote in common speech as we do when we
      talk about the rising and setting of the sun, and that all he intended to
      say was that the earth ceased to turn on its axis "for about a whole day."
    </p>
<p>
      My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of
      the earth than he did about mercy and justice. If he had known that the
      earth turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and
      swept in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty-eight thousand
      miles an hour, he would have doubled the hailstones, spoken of in the same
      chapter, that the Lord cast down from heaven, and allowed the sun and moon
      to rise and set in the usual way.
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible to conceive of a more absurd story than this about the
      stopping of the sun and moon, and yet nothing so excites the malice of the
      orthodox preacher as to call its truth in question. Some endeavor to
      account for the phenomenon by natural causes, while others attempt to show
      that God could, by the refraction of light have made the sun visible
      although actually shining on the opposite side of the earth. The last
      hypothesis has been seriously urged by ministers within the last few
      months. The Rev. Henry M. Morey of South Bend, Indiana, says "that the
      phenomenon was simply optical. The rotary motion of the earth was not
      disturbed, but the light of the sun was prolonged by the same laws of
      refraction and reflection by which the sun now appears to be above the
      horizon when it is really below. The medium through which the sun's rays
      passed may have been miraculously influenced so as to have caused the sun
      to linger above the horizon long after its usual time for disappearance."
    </p>
<p>
      This is the latest and ripest product of Christian scholarship upon this
      question no doubt, but still it is not entirely satisfactory to me.
      According to the sacred account the sun did not linger, merely, above the
      horizon, but stood still "in the midst of heaven for about a whole day,"
      that is to say, for about twelve hours. If the air was miraculously
      changed, so that it would refract the rays of the sun while the earth
      turned over as usual for "about a whole day," then, at the end of that
      time the sun must have been visible in the east, that is, it must by that
      time have been the next morning. According to this, that most wonderful
      day must have been at least thirty-six hours in length. We have first, the
      twelve hours of natural light, then twelve hours of "refracted and
      reflected" light. By that time it would again be morning, and the sun
      would shine for twelve hours more in the natural way, making thirty-six
      hours in all.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Rev. Morey would depend a little less on "refraction" and a little
      more on "reflection," he would conclude that the whole story is simply a
      barbaric myth and fable.
    </p>
<p>
      It hardly seems reasonable that God, if there is one, would either stop
      the globe, change the constitution of the atmosphere or the nature of
      light simply to afford Joshua an opportunity to kill people on that day
      when he could just as easily have waited until the next morning. It
      certainly cannot be very gratifying to God for us to believe such childish
      things.
    </p>
<p>
      It has been demonstrated that force is eternal; that it is forever active,
      and eludes destruction by change of form. Motion is a form of force, and
      all arrested motion changes instantly to heat. The earth turns upon its
      axis at about one thousand miles an hour. Let it be stopped and a force
      beyond our imagination is changed to heat. It has been calculated that to
      stop the world would produce as much heat as the burning of a solid piece
      of coal three times the size of the earth. And yet we are asked to believe
      that this was done in order that one barbarian might defeat another. Such
      stories never would have been written, had not the belief been general
      that the heavenly bodies were as nothing compared with the earth.
    </p>
<p>
      The view of Moses was acquiesced in by the Jewish people and by the
      Christian world for thousands of years. It is supposed that Moses lived
      about fifteen hundred years before Christ, and although he was "inspired,"
      and obtained his information directly from God, he did not know as much
      about our solar system as the Chinese did a thousand years before he was
      born. "The Emperor Chwenhio adopted as an epoch, a conjunction of the
      planets Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, which has been shown by M.
      Bailly to have occurred no less than 2449 years before Christ." The
      ancient Chinese knew not only the motions of the planets, but they could
      calculate eclipses. "In the reign of the Emperor Chow-Kang, the chief
      astronomers, Ho and Hi were condemned to death for neglecting to announce
      a solar eclipse which took place 2169 B. C., a clear proof that the
      prediction of eclipses was a part of the duty of the imperial
      astronomers."
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not strange that a Chinaman should find out by his own exertions
      more about the material universe than Moses could when assisted by its
      Creator?
    </p>
<p>
      About eight hundred years after God gave Moses the principal facts about
      the creation of the "heaven and the earth" he performed another miracle
      far more wonderful than stopping the world. On this occasion he not only
      stopped the earth, but actually caused it to turn the other way. A Jewish
      king was sick, and God, in order to convince him that he would ultimately
      recover, offered to make the shadow on the dial go forward, or backward
      ten degrees. The king thought it was too easy a thing to make the shadow
      go forward, and asked that it be turned back. Thereupon, "Isaiah the
      prophet cried unto the Lord, and he brought the shadow ten degrees
      backward by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz." I hardly see how
      this miracle could be accounted for even by "refraction" and "reflection."
    </p>
<p>
      It seems, from the account, that this stupendous miracle was performed
      after the king had been cured. The account of the shadow going backward is
      given in the eleventh verse of the twentieth chapter of Second Kings,
      while the cure is given in the seventh verse of the same chapter. "And
      Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil,
      and he recovered."
    </p>
<p>
      Stopping the world and causing it to turn back ten degrees after that,
      seems to have been, as the boil was already cured by the figs, a useless
      display of power.
    </p>
<p>
      The easiest way to account for all these wonders is to say that the
      "inspired" writers were mistaken. In this way a fearful burden is lifted
      from the credulity of man, and he is left free to believe the evidences of
      his own senses, and the demonstrations of science. In this way he can
      emancipate himself from the slavery of superstition, the control of the
      barbaric dead, and the despotism of the church.
    </p>
<p>
      Only about a hundred years ago, Buffon, the naturalist, was compelled by
      the faculty of theology at Paris to publicly renounce fourteen "errors" in
      his work on Natural History because they were at variance with the Mosaic
      account of creation. The Pentateuch is still the scientific standard of
      the church, and ignorant priests, armed with that, pronounce sentence upon
      the vast accomplishments of modern thought.
    </p>
<p>
      X. "HE MADE THE STARS ALSO."
    </p>
<p>
      Moses came very near forgetting about the stars, and only gave five words
      to all the hosts of heaven. Can it be possible that he knew anything about
      the stars beyond the mere fact that he saw them shining above him?
    </p>
<p>
      Did he know that the nearest star, the one we ought to be the best
      acquainted with, is twenty-one billion of miles away, and that it is a sun
      shining by its own light? Did he know of the next, that is thirty-seven
      billion miles distant? Is it possible that he was acquainted with Sirius,
      a sun two thousand six hundred and eighty-eight times larger than our own,
      surrounded by a system of heavenly bodies, several of which are already
      known, and distant from us eighty-two billion miles? Did he know that the
      Polar star that tells the mariner his course and guided slaves to liberty
      and joy, is distant from this little world two hundred and ninety-two
      billion miles, and that Capella wheels and shines one hundred and
      thirty-three billion miles beyond? Did he know that it would require about
      seventy-two years for light to reach us from this star? Did he know that
      light travels one hundred and eighty-five thousand miles a second? Did he
      know that some stars are so far away in the infinite abysses that five
      millions of years are required for their light to reach this globe?
    </p>
<p>
      If this is true, and if as the Bible tells us, the stars were made after
      the earth, then this world has been wheeling in its orbit for at least
      five million years.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be replied that it was not the intention of God to teach geology
      and astronomy. Then why did he say anything upon these subjects? and if he
      did say anything, why did he not give the facts?
    </p>
<p>
      According to the sacred records God created, on the first day, the heaven
      and the earth, "moved upon the face of the waters," and made the light. On
      the second day he made the firmament or the "expanse" and divided the
      waters. On the third day he gathered the waters into seas, let the dry
      land appear and caused the earth to bring forth grass, herbs and fruit
      trees, and on the fourth day he made the sun, moon and stars and set them
      in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth. This division of
      labor is very striking. The work of the other days is as nothing when
      compared with that of the fourth. Is it possible that it required the same
      time and labor to make the grass, herbs and fruit trees, that it did to
      fill with countless constellations the infinite expanse of space?
    </p>
<p>
      XI. FRIDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      We are then told that on the next day "God the moving creatures that hath
      life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of
      heaven. And God created great whales and every living creature which the
      waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl
      after his kind, and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them,
      saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let
      fowl multiply in the earth."
    </p>
<p>
      Is it true that while the dry land was covered with grass, and herbs, and
      trees bearing fruit, the ocean was absolutely devoid of life, and so
      remained for millions of years?
    </p>
<p>
      If Moses meant twenty-four hours by the word day, then it would make but
      little difference on which of the six days animals were made; but if the
      word said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly day was used to express
      millions of ages, during which life was slowly evolved from monad up to
      man, then the account becomes infinitely absurd, puerile and foolish.
      There is not a scientist of high standing who will say that in his
      judgment the earth was covered with fruit-bearing trees before the moners,
      the ancestors it may be of the human race, felt in Laurentian seas the
      first faint throb of life. Nor is there one who will declare that there
      was a single spire of grass before the sun had poured upon the world his
      flood of gold.
    </p>
<p>
      Why should men in the name of religion try to harmonize the contradictions
      that exist between Nature and a book? Why should philosophers be denounced
      for placing more reliance upon what they know than upon what they have
      been told? If there is a God, it is reasonably certain that he made the
      world, but it is by no means certain that he is the author of the Bible.
      Why then should we not place greater confidence in Nature than in a book?
      And even if this God made not only the world but the book besides, it does
      not follow that the book is the best part of creation, and the only part
      that we will be eternally punished for denying. It seems to me that it is
      quite as important to know something of the solar system, something of the
      physical history of this globe, as it is to know the adventures of Jonah
      or the diet of Ezekiel. For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all
      the results of scientific investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was.
      Supposing the Bible to be true; why is it any worse or more wicked for
      Freethinkers to deny it, than for priests to deny the doctrine of
      evolution, or the dynamic theory of heat? Why should we be damned for
      laughing at Samson and his foxes, while others, holding the Nebular
      Hypothesis in utter contempt, go straight to heaven? It seems to me that a
      belief in the great truths of science are fully as essential to salvation,
      as the creed of any church. We are taught that a man may be perfectly
      acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity of the earth, the
      Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the indestructibility of
      matter and the attraction of gravitation. And we are also taught that a
      man may be right upon all these questions, and yet, for failing to believe
      in the "scheme of salvation," be eternally lost.
    </p>
<p>
      XII. SATURDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      On this, the last day of creation, God said;—
    </p>
<p>
      "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and
      creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind; and it was so. And
      God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their
      kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and God
      saw that it was good."
    </p>
<p>
      Now, is it true that the seas were filled with fish, the sky with fowls,
      and the earth covered with grass, and herbs, and fruit bearing trees,
      millions of ages before there was a creeping thing in existence? Must we
      admit that plants and animals were the result of the fiat of some
      incomprehensible intelligence independent of the operation of what are
      known as natural causes? Why is a miracle any more necessary to account
      for yesterday than for to-day or for to-morrow?
    </p>
<p>
      If there is an infinite Power, nothing can be more certain than that this
      Power works in accordance with what we call law, that is, by and through
      natural causes. If anything can be found without a pedigree of natural
      antecedents, it will then be time enough to talk about the fiat of
      creation. There must have been a time when plants and animals did not
      exist upon this globe. The question, and the only question is, whether
      they were naturally produced. If the account given by Moses is true, then
      the vegetable and animal existences are the result of certain special
      fiats of creation entirely independent of the operation of natural causes.
      This is so grossly improbable, so at variance with the experience and
      observation of mankind, that it cannot be adopted without abandoning
      forever the basis of scientific thought and action.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be urged that we do not understand the sacred record correctly. To
      this it may be replied that for thousands of years the account of the
      creation has, by the Jewish and Christian world, been regarded as
      literally true. If it was inspired, of course God must have known just how
      it would be understood, and consequently must have intended that it should
      be understood just as he knew it would be. One man writing to another, may
      mean one thing, and yet be understood as meaning something else. Now, if
      the writer knew that he would be misunderstood, and also knew that he
      could use other words that would convey his real meaning, but did not, we
      would say that he used words on purpose to mislead, and was not an honest
      man.
    </p>
<p>
      If a being of infinite wisdom wrote the Bible, or caused it to be written,
      he must have known exactly how his words would be interpreted by all the
      world, and he must have intended to convey the very meaning that was
      conveyed. He must have known that by reading that book, man would form
      erroneous views as to the shape, antiquity, and size of this world; that
      he would be misled as to the time and order of creation; that he would
      have the most childish and contemptible views of the creator; that the
      "sacred word" would be used to support slavery and polygamy; that it would
      build dungeons for the good, and light fagots to consume the brave, and
      therefore he must have intended that these results should follow. He also
      must have known that thousands and millions of men and women never could
      believe his Bible, and that the number of unbelievers would increase in
      the exact ratio of civilization, and therefore, he must have intended that
      result.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us understand this. An honest finite being uses the best words, in his
      judgment, to convey his meaning. This is the best he can do, because he
      cannot certainly know the exact effect of his words on others. But an
      infinite being must know not only the real meaning of the words, but the
      exact meaning they will convey to every reader and hearer. He must know
      every meaning that they are capable of conveying to every mind. He must
      also know what explanations must be made to prevent misconception. If an
      infinite being cannot, in making a revelation to man, use such words that
      every person to whom a revelation is essential will understand distinctly
      what that revelation is, then a revelation from God through the
      instrumentality of language is impossible, or it is not essential that all
      should understand it correctly. It may be urged that millions have not the
      capacity to understand a revelation, although expressed in the plainest
      words. To this it seems a sufficient reply to ask, why a being of infinite
      power should create men so devoid of intelligence, that he cannot by any
      means make known to them his will? We are told that it is exceedingly
      plain, and that a wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein. This
      statement is refuted by the religious history of the Christian world.
      Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will to
      man. To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning. About the
      meaning of this book, called a revelation, there have been ages of war,
      and centuries of sword and flame. If written by an infinite God, he must
      have known that these results must follow; and thus knowing, he must be
      responsible for all.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work of
      man, that it is filled with mingled truth and error, with mistakes and
      facts, and reflects, too faithfully perhaps, the "very form and pressure
      of its time"?
    </p>
<p>
      If there are mistakes in the Bible, certainly they were made by man. If
      there is anything contrary to nature, it was written by man. If there is
      anything immoral, cruel, heartless or infamous, it certainly was never
      written by a being worthy of the adoration of mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      XIII. LET US MAKE MAN.
    </p>
<p>
      We are next informed by the author of the Pentateuch that God said "Let us
      make man in our image, after our likeness," and that "God created man in
      his own image, in the image of God created he him—male and female
      created he them."
    </p>
<p>
      If this account means anything, it means that man was created in the
      physical image and likeness of God. Moses while he speaks of man as having
      been made in the image of God, never speaks of God except as having the
      form of a man. He speaks of God as "walking in the garden in the cool of
      the day;" and that Adam and Eve "heard his voice." He is constantly
      telling what God said, and in a thousand passages he refers to him as not
      only having the human form, but as performing actions, such as man
      performs. The God of Moses was a God with hands, with feet, with the
      organs of speech.
    </p>
<p>
      A God of passion, of hatred, of revenge, of affection, of repentance; a
      God who made mistakes:—in other words, an immense and powerful man.
    </p>
<p>
      It will not do to say that Moses meant to convey the idea that God made
      man in his mental or moral image. Some have insisted that man was made in
      the moral image of God because he was made pure. Purity cannot be
      manufactured. A moral character cannot be made for man by a god. Every man
      must make his own moral character. Consequently, if God is infinitely
      pure, Adam and Eve were not made in his image in that respect. Others say
      that Adam and Eve were made in the mental image of God. If it is meant by
      that, that they were created with reasoning powers like, but not to the
      extent of those possessed by a god, then this may be admitted. But
      certainly this idea was not in the mind of Moses. He regarded the human
      form as being in the image of God, and for that reason always spoke of God
      as having that form. No one can read the Pentateuch without coming to the
      conclusion that the author supposed that man was created in the physical
      likeness of Deity. God said "Go to, let us go down." "God smelled a sweet
      savor;" "God repented him that he had made man;" "and God said;" and
      "walked;" and "talked;" and "rested." All these expressions are
      inconsistent with any other idea than that the person using them regarded
      God as having the form of man.
    </p>
<p>
      As a matter of fact, it is impossible for a man to conceive of a personal
      God, other than as a being having the human form. No one can think of an
      infinite being having the form of a horse, or of a bird, or of any animal
      beneath man. It is one of the necessities of the mind to associate forms
      with intellectual capacities. The highest form of which we have any
      conception is man's, and consequently, his is the only form that we can
      find in imagination to give to a personal God, because all other forms
      are, in our minds, connected with lower intelligences.
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible to think of a personal God as a spirit without form. We
      can use these words, but they do not convey to the mind any real and
      tangible meaning. Every one who thinks of a personal God at all, thinks of
      him as having the human form. Take from God the idea of form; speak of him
      simply as an all pervading spirit—which means an all pervading
      something about which we know nothing—and Pantheism is the result.
    </p>
<p>
      We are told that God made man; and the question naturally arises, how was
      this done? Was it by a process of "evolution," "development;" the
      "transmission of acquired habits;" the "survival of the fittest," or was
      the necessary amount of clay kneaded to the proper consistency, and then
      by the hands of God moulded into form? Modern science tells that man has
      been evolved, through countless epochs, from the lower forms; that he is
      the result of almost an infinite number of actions, reactions,
      experiences, states, forms, wants and adaptations. Did Moses intend to
      convey such a meaning, or did he believe that God took a sufficient amount
      of dust, made it the proper shape, and breathed into it the breath of
      life? Can any believer in the Bible give any reasonable account of this
      process of creation? Is it possible to imagine what was really done? Is
      there any theologian who will contend that man was created directly from
      the earth? Will he say that man was made substantially as he now is, with
      all his muscles properly developed for walking and speaking, and
      performing every variety of human action? That all his bones were formed
      as they now are, and all the relations of nerve, ligament, brain and
      motion as they are to-day?
    </p>
<p>
      Looking back over the history of animal life from the lowest to the
      highest forms, we find that there has been a slow and gradual development;
      a certain but constant relation between want and production; between use
      and form. The Moner is said to be the simplest form of animal life that
      has yet been found. It has been described as "an organism without organs."
      It is a kind of structureless structure; a little mass of transparent
      jelly that can flatten itself out, and can expand and contract around its
      food. It can feed without a mouth, digest without a stomach, walk without
      feet, and reproduce itself by simple division. By taking this Moner as the
      commencement of animal life, or rather as the first animal, it is easy to
      follow the development of the organic structure through all the forms of
      life to man himself. In this way finally every muscle, bone and joint,
      every organ, form and function may be accounted for. In this way, and in
      this way only, can the existence of rudimentary organs be explained. Blot
      from the human mind the ideas of evolution, heredity, adaptation, and "the
      survival of the fittest," with which it has been enriched by Lamarck,
      Goethe, Darwin, Haeckel and Spencer, and all the facts in the history of
      animal life become utterly disconnected and meaningless.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall we throw away all that has been discovered with regard to organic
      life, and in its place take the statements of one who lived in the rude
      morning of a barbaric day? Will anybody now contend that man was a direct
      and independent creation, and sustains and bears no relation to the
      animals below him? Belief upon this subject must be governed at last by
      evidence. Man cannot believe as he pleases. He can control his speech, and
      can say that he believes or disbelieves; but after all, his will cannot
      depress or raise the scales with which his reason finds the worth and
      weight of facts. If this is not so, investigation, evidence, judgment and
      reason are but empty words.
    </p>
<p>
      I ask again, how were Adam and Eve created? In one account they are
      created male and female, and apparently at the same time. In the next
      account, Adam is made first, and Eve a long time afterwards, and from a
      part of the man. Did God simply by his creative fiat cause a rib slowly to
      expand, grow and divide into nerve, ligament, cartilage and flesh? How was
      the woman created from a rib? How was man created simply from dust? For my
      part, I cannot believe this statement.
    </p>
<p>
      I may suffer for this in the world to come; and may, millions of years
      hence, sincerely wish that I had never investigated the subject, but had
      been content to take the ideas of the dead. I do not believe that any
      deity works in that way. So far as my experience goes, there is an
      unbroken procession of cause and effect. Each thing is a necessary link in
      an infinite chain; and I cannot conceive of this chain being broken even
      for one instant. Back of the simplest moner there is a cause, and back of
      that another, and so on, it seems to me, forever. In my philosophy I
      postulate neither beginning nor ending.

<p>
      If the Mosaic account is true, we know how long man has been upon this
      earth. If that account can be relied on, the first man was made about five
      thousand eight hundred and eighty-three years ago. Sixteen hundred and
      fifty-six years after the making of the first man, the inhabitants of the
      world, with the exception of eight people, were destroyed by a flood. This
      flood occurred only about four thousand two hundred and twenty-seven years
      ago. If this account is correct, at that time, only one kind of men
      existed. Noah and his family were certainly of the same blood. It
      therefore follows that all the differences we see between the various
      races of men have been caused in about four thousand years. If the account
      of the deluge is true, then since that event all the ancient kingdoms of
      the earth were founded, and their inhabitants passed through all the
      stages of savage, nomadic, barbaric and semi-civilized life; through the
      epochs of Stone, Bronze and Iron; established commerce, cultivated the
      arts, built cities, filled them with palaces and temples, invented
      writing, produced a literature and slowly fell to shapeless ruin. We must
      believe that all this has happened within a period of four thousand years.
    </p>
<p>
      From representations found upon Egyptian granite made more than three
      thousand years ago, we know that the negro was as black, his lips as full,
      and his hair as closely curled then as now. If we know anything, we know
      that there was at that time substantially the same difference between the
      Egyptian and the Negro as now. If we know anything, we know that
      magnificent statues were made in Egypt four thousand years before our era—that
      is to say, about six thousand years ago. There was at the World's
      Exposition, in the Egyptian department, a statue of king Cephren, known to
      have been chiseled more than six thousand years ago. In other words, if
      the Mosaic account must be believed, this statue was made before the
      world. We also know, if we know anything, that men lived in v Europe with
      the hairy mammoth, the cave bear, the rhinoceros, and the hyena. Among the
      bones of these animals have been found the stone hatchets and flint arrows
      of our ancestors. In the caves where they lived have been discovered the
      remains of these animals that had been conquered, killed and devoured as
      food, hundreds of thousands of years ago.
    </p>
<p>
      If these facts are true, Moses was mistaken. For my part, I have
      infinitely more confidence in the discoveries of to-day, than in the
      records of a barbarous people. It will not now do to say that man has
      existed upon this earth for only about six thousand years. One can hardly
      compute in his imagination the time necessary for man to emerge from the
      barbarous state, naked and helpless, surrounded by animals far more
      powerful than he, to progress and finally create the civilizations of
      India, Egypt and Athens. The distance from savagery to Shakespeare must be
      measured not by hundreds, but by millions of years.

      XIV. SUNDAY.
    </p>
<p>
      "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made, and he
      rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God
      blessed the seventh day and sanctified it; because that in it he had
      rested from all his work which God created and made."
    </p>
<p>
      The great work had been accomplished, the world, the sun, and moon, and
      all the hosts of heaven were finished; the earth was clothed in green, the
      seas were filled with life, the cattle wandered by the brooks—insects
      with painted wings were in the happy air, Adam and Eve were making each
      others acquaintance, and God was resting from his work. He was
      contemplating the accomplishments of a week.
    </p>
<p>
      Because he rested on that day he sanctified it, and for that reason and
      for that alone, it was by the Jews considered a holy day. If he only
      rested on that day, there ought to be some account of what he did the
      following Monday. Did he rest on that day? What did he do after he got
      rested? Has he done anything in the way of creation since Saturday evening
      of the first week?
    </p>
<p>
      It is now claimed by the "scientific" Christians that the "days" of
      creation were not ordinary days of twenty-four hours each, but immensely
      long periods of time. If they are right, then how long was the seventh
      day? Was that, too, a geologic period covering thousands of ages? That
      cannot be, because Adam and Eve were created the Saturday evening before,
      and according to the Bible that was about five thousand eight hundred and
      eighty-three years ago. I cannot state the time exactly, because there
      have been as many as one hundred and forty different opinions given by
      learned Biblical students as to the time between the creation of the world
      and the birth of Christ. We are quite certain, however, that, according to
      the Bible, it is not more than six thousand years since the creation of
      Adam. From this it would appear that the seventh day was not a geologic
      epoch, but was in fact a period of less than six thousand years, and
      probably of only twenty-four hours.
    </p>
<p>
      The theologians who "answer" these things may take their choice. If they
      take the ground that the "days" were periods of twenty-four hours, then
      geology will force them to throw away the whole account. If, on the other
      hand, they admit that the days were vast "periods," then the sacredness of
      the Sabbath must be given up.
    </p>
<p>
      There is found in the Bible no intimation that there was the least
      difference in the days. They are all spoken of in the same way. It may be
      replied that our translation is incorrect. If this is so, then only those
      who understand Hebrew, have had a revelation from God, and all the rest
      have been deceived.
    </p>
<p>
      How is it possible to sanctify a space of time? Is rest holier than labor?
      If there is any difference between days, ought not that to be considered
      best in which the most useful labor has been performed?
    </p>
<p>
      Of all the superstitions of mankind, this insanity about the "sacred
      Sabbath" is the most absurd. The idea of feeling it a duty to be solemn
      and sad one-seventh of the time! To think that we can please an infinite
      being by staying in some dark and sombre room, instead of walking in the
      perfumed fields! Why should God hate to see a man happy? Why should it
      excite his wrath to see a family in the woods, by some babbling stream,
      talking, laughing and loving? Nature works on that "sacred" day. The earth
      turns, the rivers run, the trees grow, buds burst into flower, and birds
      fill the air with song. Why should we look sad, and think about death, and
      hear about hell? Why should that day be filled with gloom instead of joy?
    </p>
<p>
      A poor mechanic, working all the week in dust and noise, needs a day of
      rest and joy, a day to visit stream and wood—a day to live with wife
      and child; a day in which to laugh at care, and gather hope and strength
      for toils to come. And his weary wife needs a breath of sunny air, away
      from street and wall, amid the hills or by the margin of the sea, where
      she can sit and prattle with her babe, and fill with happy dreams the
      long, glad day.
    </p>
<p>
      The "Sabbath" was born of asceticism, hatred of human joy, fanaticism,
      ignorance, egotism of priests and the cowardice of the people. This day,
      for thousands of years, has been dedicated to superstition, to the
      dissemination of mistakes, and the establishment of falsehoods. Every
      Freethinker, as a matter of duty, should violate this day. He should
      assert his independence, and do all within his power to wrest the Sabbath
      from the gloomy church and give it back to liberty and joy. Freethinkers
      should make the Sabbath a day of mirth and music; a day to spend with wife
      and child—a day of games, and books, and dreams—a day to put
      fresh flowers above our sleeping dead—a day of memory and hope, of
      love and rest.
    </p>
<p>
      Why should we in this age of the world be dominated by the dead? Why
      should barbarian Jews who went down to death and dust three thousand years
      ago, control the living world? Why should we care for the superstition of
      men who began the Sabbath by paring their nails, "beginning at the fourth
      finger, then going to the second, then to the fifth, then to the third,
      and ending with the thumb?" How pleasing to God this must have been. The
      Jews were very careful of these nail parings. They who threw them upon the
      ground were wicked, because Satan used them to work evil upon the earth.
      They believed that upon the Sabbath, souls were allowed to leave purgatory
      and cool their burning souls in water. Fires were neither allowed to be
      kindled nor extinguished, and upon that day it was a sin to bind up
      wounds. "The lame might use a staff, but the blind could not." So strict
      was the Sabbath kept, that at one time "if a Jew on a journey was
      overtaken by the 'sacred day' in a wood, or on the highway, no matter
      where, nor under what circumstances, he must sit down," and there remain
      until the day was gone. "If he fell down in the dirt, there he was
      compelled to stay until the day was done." For violating the Sabbath, the
      punishment was death, for nothing short of the offender's blood could
      satisfy the wrath of God. There are, in the Old Testament, two reasons
      given for abstaining from labor on the Sabbath:—the resting of God,
      and the redemption of the Jews from the bondage of Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      Since the establishment of the Christian religion, the day has been
      changed, and Christians do not regard the day as holy upon which God
      actually rested, and which he sanctified. The Christian Sabbath, or the
      "Lord's day" was legally established by the murderer Constantine, because
      upon that day Christ was supposed to have risen from the dead.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not easy to see where Christians got the right to disregard the
      direct command of God, to labor on the day he sanctified, and keep as
      sacred, a day upon which he commanded men to labor. The Sabbath of God is
      Saturday, and if any day is to be kept holy, that is the one, and not the
      Sunday of the Christian.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us throw away these superstitions and take the higher, nobler ground,
      that every day should be rendered sacred by some loving act, by increasing
      the happinesss of man, giving birth to noble thoughts, putting in the path
      of toil some flower of joy, helping the unfortunate, lifting the fallen,
      dispelling gloom, destroying prejudice, defending the helpless and filling
      homes with light and love.
    </p>
<p>
      XV. THE NECESSITY FOR A GOOD MEMORY.
    </p>
<p>
      It must not be forgotten that there are two accounts of the creation in
      Genesis. The first account stops with the third verse of the second
      chapter. The chapters have been improperly divided. In the original Hebrew
      the Pentateuch was neither divided into chapters nor verses. There was not
      even any system of punctuation. It was written wholly with consonants,
      without vowels, and without any marks, dots, or lines to indicate them.
    </p>
<p>
      These accounts are materially different, and both cannot be true. Let us
      see wherein they differ.
    </p>
<p>
      The second account of the creation begins with the fourth verse of the
      second chapter, and is as follows:
    </p>
<p>
      "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were
      created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
    </p>
<p>
      "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb
      of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain
      upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
    </p>
<p>
      "But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the
      ground.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into
      his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the
      man whom he had formed.
    </p>
<p>
      "And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
      pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
      midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
    </p>
<p>
      "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was
      parted and became into four heads.
    </p>
<p>
      "The name of the first is Pison; that is it which compasseth the whole
      land of Havilah, where there is gold.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth
      the whole land of Ethiopia.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is it which goeth
      toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to
      dress it and to keep it.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden
      thou mayest freely eat; But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
      thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
      shalt surely die.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I
      will make him an helpmeet for him.
    </p>
<p>
      "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and
      every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would
      call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the
      name thereof.
    </p>
<p>
      "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to
      every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helpmeet for
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and
      he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
    </p>
<p>
      "And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman and
      brought her unto the man.
    </p>
<p>
      "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she
      shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
    </p>
<p>
      "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave
      unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.
    </p>
<p>
      "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
    </p>
<p>
      Order of creation in the first account:
    </p>
<p>
      1. The heaven and the earth, and light were made.
    </p>
<p>
      2. The firmament was constructed and the waters divided.
    </p>
<p>
      3. The waters gathered into seas—and then came dry land, grass,
      herbs and fruit trees.
    </p>
<p>
      4. The sun and moon. He made the stars also.
    </p>
<p>
      5. Fishes, fowls, and great whales.
    </p>
<p>
      6. Beasts, cattle, every creeping thing, man and woman.
    </p>
<p>
      Order of creation in the second account:
    </p>
<p>
      1. The heavens and the earth.
    </p>
<p>
      2. A mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole face of the
      ground.
    </p>
<p>
      3. Created a man out of dust, by the name of Adam.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Planted a garden eastward in Eden, and put the man in it.
    </p>
<p>
      5. Created the beasts and fowls.
    </p>
<p>
      6. Created a woman out of one of the man's ribs.
    </p>
<p>
      In the second account, man was made <i>before</i> the beasts and fowls. If
      this is true, the first account is false. And if the theologians of our
      time are correct in their view that the Mosaic day means thousands of
      ages, then, according to the second account, Adam existed millions of
      years before Eve was formed. He must have lived one Mosaic day before
      there were any trees, and another Mosaic day before the beasts and fowls
      were created. Will some kind clergymen tell us upon what kind of food Adam
      subsisted during these immense periods?
    </p>
<p>
      In the second account a man is made, and the fact that he was without a
      helpmeet did not occur to the Lord God until a couple "of vast periods"
      afterwards. The Lord God suddenly coming to an appreciation of the
      situation said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make
      him an helpmeet for him."
    </p>
<p>
      Now, after concluding to make "an helpmeet" for Adam, what did the Lord
      God do? Did he at once proceed to make a woman? No. What did he do? He
      made the beasts, and tried to induce Adam to take one of them for "an
      helpmeet." If I am incorrect, read the following account, and tell me what
      it means:
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I
      will make him an helpmeet for him.
    </p>
<p>
      "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and
      every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would
      call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the
      name thereof.
    </p>
<p>
      "And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to
      every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an helpmeet for
      him."
    </p>
<p>
      Unless the Lord God was looking for an helpmeet for Adam, why did he cause
      the animals to pass before him? And why did he, after the menagerie had
      passed by, pathetically exclaim, "But for Adam there was not found an
      helpmeet for him"?
    </p>
<p>
      It seems that Adam saw nothing that struck his fancy. The fairest ape, the
      sprightliest chimpanzee, the loveliest baboon, the most bewitching
      orangoutang, the most fascinating gorilla failed to touch with love's
      sweet pain, poor Adam's lonely heart. Let us rejoice that this was so. Had
      he fallen in love then, there never would have been a Freethinker in this
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Adam Clarke, speaking of this remarkable proceeding says:—"God
      caused the animals to pass before Adam to show him that no creature yet
      formed could make him a suitable companion; that Adam was convinced that
      none of these animals could be a suitable companion for him, and that
      therefore he must continue in a state that was not good (celibacy) unless
      he became a further debtor to the bounty of his maker, for among all the
      animals which he had formed, there was not a helpmeet for Adam."
    </p>
<p>
      Upon this same subject, Dr. Scott informs us "that it was not conducive to
      the happiness of the man to remain without the consoling society, and
      endearment of tender friendship, nor consistent with the end of his
      creation to be without marriage by which the earth might be replenished
      and worshipers and servants raised up to render him praise and glory. Adam
      seems to have been vastly better acquainted by intuition or revelation
      with the distinct properties of every creature than the most sagacious
      observer since the fall of man.
    </p>
<p>
      "Upon this review of the animals, not one was found in outward form his
      counterpart, nor one suited to engage his affections, participate in his
      enjoyments, or associate with him in the worship of God."
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Matthew Henry admits that "God brought all the animals together to see
      if there was a suitable match for Adam in any of the numerous families of
      the inferior creatures, but there was none. They were all looked over, but
      Adam could not be matched among them all. Therefore God created a new
      thing to be a helpmeet for him."
    </p>
<p>
      Failing to satisfy Adam with any of the inferior animals, the Lord God
      caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in this sleep took out one
      of Adam's ribs and "closed up the flesh instead thereof." And out of this
      rib, the Lord God made a woman, and brought her to the man.
    </p>
<p>
      Was the Lord God compelled to take a part of the man because he had used
      up all the original "nothing" out of which the universe was made? Is it
      possible for any sane and intelligent man to believe this story? Must a
      man be born a second time before this account seems reasonable?
    </p>
<p>
      Imagine the Lord God with a bone in his hand with which to start a woman,
      trying to make up his mind whether to make a blonde or a brunette!
    </p>
<p>
      Just at this point it may be proper for me to warn all persons from
      laughing at or making light of, any stories found in the "Holy Bible."
      When you come to die, every laugh will be a thorn in your pillow. At that
      solemn moment, as you look back upon the records of your life, no matter
      how many men you may have wrecked and ruined; no matter how many women you
      have deceived and deserted, all that can be forgiven; but if you remember
      then that you have laughed at even one story in God's "sacred book" you
      will see through the gathering shadows of death the forked tongues of
      devils, and the leering eyes of fiends.
    </p>
<p>
      These stories must be believed, or the work of regeneration can never be
      commenced. No matter how well you act your part, live as honestly as you
      may, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, divide your last farthing with the
      poor, and you are simply traveling the broad road that leads inevitably to
      eternal death, unless at the same time you implicitly believe the Bible to
      be the inspired word of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me show you the result of unbelief. Let us suppose, for a moment, that
      we are at the Day of Judgment, listening to the trial of souls as they
      arrive. The Recording Secretary, or whoever does the cross-examining, says
      to a soul:
    </p>
<p>
      Where are you from?
    </p>
<p>
      I am from the Earth.
    </p>
<p>
      What kind of a man were you?
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I don't like to talk about myself. I suppose you can tell by looking
      at your books.
    </p>
<p>
      No, sir. You must tell what kind of a man you were.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I was what you might call a first-rate fellow. I loved my wife and
      children. My home was my heaven. My fireside was a paradise to me. To sit
      there and see the lights and shadows fall upon the faces of those I loved,
      was to me a perfect joy.
    </p>
<p>
      How did you treat your family?
    </p>
<p>
      I never said an unkind word. I never caused my wife, nor one of my
      children, a moments pain.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you pay your debts?
    </p>
<p>
      I did not owe a dollar when I died, and left enough to pay my funeral
      expenses, and to keep the fierce wolf of want from the door of those I
      loved.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you belong to any church?
    </p>
<p>
      No, sir. They were too narrow, pinched and bigoted for me, I never thought
      that I could be very happy if other folks were damned.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you believe in eternal punishment?
    </p>
<p>
      Well, no. I always thought that God could get his revenge in far less
      time.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you believe the rib story?
    </p>
<p>
      Do you mean the Adam and Eve business?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes! Did you believe that?
    </p>
<p>
      To tell you the God's truth, that was just a little more than I could
      swallow.
    </p>
<p>
      Away with him to hell!
    </p>
<p>
      Next!
    </p>
<p>
      Where are you from?
    </p>
<p>
      I am from the world too.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you belong to any church?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, sir, and to the Young Men's Christian Association besides.
    </p>
<p>
      What was your business?
    </p>
<p>
      Cashier in a Savings Bank.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you ever run away with any money?
    </p>
<p>
      Where I came from, a witness could not be compelled to criminate himself.
    </p>
<p>
      The law is different here. Answer the question. Did you run away with any
      money?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      How much?
    </p>
<p>
      One hundred thousand dollars.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you take anything else with you?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, what else?
    </p>
<p>
      I took my neighbor's wife—we sang together in the choir.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you have a wife and children of your own? Yes, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      And you deserted them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, sir, but such was my confidence in God that I believed he would take
      care of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Have you heard of them since?
    </p>
<p>
      No, sir.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you believe in the rib story?
    </p>
<p>
      Bless your soul, of course I did. A thousand times I regretted that there
      were no harder stories in the Bible, so that I could have shown my wealth
      of faith.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you believe the rib story yet?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, with all my heart.
    </p>
<p>
      Give him a harp!
    </p>
<p>
      Well, as I was saying, God made a woman from Adam's rib. Of course, I do
      not know exactly how this was done, but when he got the woman finished, he
      presented her to Adam. He liked her, and they commenced house-keeping in
      the celebrated Garden of Eden.
    </p>
<p>
      Must we, in order to be good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that
      the creation of woman was a second thought? That Jehovah really endeavored
      to induce Adam to take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?
      After all, is it not possible to live honest and courageous lives without
      believing these fables? It is said that from Mount Sinai God gave, amid
      thunderings and lightnings, ten commandments for the guidance of mankind;
      and yet among them is not found—"Thou shalt believe the Bible."
    </p>
<p>
      XVI. THE GARDEN.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first account we are told that God made man, male and female, and
      said to them "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth and
      subdue it."
    </p>
<p>
      In the second account only the man is made, and he is put in a garden "to
      dress it and to keep it." He is not told to subdue the earth, but to dress
      and keep a garden.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first account man is given every herb bearing seed upon the face of
      the earth and the fruit of every tree for food, and in the second, he is
      given only the fruit of all the trees in the garden with the exception "of
      the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" which was a deadly poison.
    </p>
<p>
      There was issuing from this garden a river that was parted into four
      heads. The first of these, Pison, compassed the whole land of Havilah, the
      second, Gihon, that compassed the whole land of Ethiopia.
    </p>
<p>
      The third, Heddekel, that flowed toward the east of Assyria, and the
      fourth, the Euphrates. Where are these four rivers now? The brave prow of
      discovery has visited every sea; the traveler has pressed with weary feet
      the soil of every clime; and yet there has been found no place from which
      four rivers sprang. The Euphrates still journeys to the gulf, but where
      are Pison, Gihon and the mighty Heddekel? Surely by going to the source of
      the Euphrates we ought to find either these three rivers or their ancient
      beds. Will some minister when he answers the "Mistakes of Moses" tell us
      where these rivers are or were? The maps of the world are incomplete
      without these mighty streams. We have discovered the sources of the Nile;
      the North Pole will soon be touched by an American; but these three rivers
      still rise in unknown hills, still flow through unknown lands, and empty
      still in unknown seas.
    </p>
<p>
      The account of these four rivers is what the Rev. David Swing would call
      "a geographical poem." The orthodox clergy cover the whole affair with the
      blanket of allegory, while the "scientific" Christian folks talk about
      cataclysms, upheavals, earthquakes, and vast displacements of the earth's
      crust.
    </p>
<p>
      The question, then arises, whether within the last six thousand years
      there have been such upheavals and displacements? Talk as you will about
      the vast "creative periods" that preceded the appearance of man; it is,
      according to the Bible, only about six thousand years since man was
      created. Moses gives us the generations of men from Adam until his day,
      and this account cannot be explained away by calling centuries, days.
    </p>
<p>
      According to the second account of creation, these four rivers were made
      after the creation of man, and consequently they must have been
      obliterated by convulsions of Nature within six thousand years.
    </p>
<p>
      Can we not account for these contradictions, absurdities, and falsehoods
      by simply saying that although the writer may have done his level best, he
      failed because he was limited in knowledge, led away by tradition, and
      depended too implicitly upon the correctness of his imagination? Is not
      such a course far more reasonable than to insist that all these things are
      true and must stand though every science shall fall to mental dust?
    </p>
<p>
      Can any reason be given for not allowing man to eat of the fruit of the
      tree of knowledge? What kind of tree was that? If it is all an allegory,
      what truth is sought to be conveyed? Why should God object to that fruit
      being eaten by man? Why did he put it in the midst of the garden? There
      was certainly plenty of room outside. If he wished to keep man and this
      tree apart, why did he put them together? And why, after he had eaten, was
      he thrust out? The only answer that we have a right to give, is the one
      given in the Bible. "And the Lord God said, Behold the man has become as
      one of us to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and
      take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: Therefore the
      Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground from
      whence he was taken."
    </p>
<p>
      Will some minister, some graduate of Andover, tell us what this means? Are
      we bound to believe it without knowing what the meaning is? If it is a
      revelation, what does it reveal? Did God object to education then, and
      does that account for the hostile attitude still assumed by theologians
      toward all scientific truth? Was there in the garden a tree of life, the
      eating of which would have rendered Adam and Eve immortal? Is it true,
      that after the Lord God drove them from the garden that he placed upon its
      Eastern side "Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep
      the way of the tree of life?" Are the Cherubim and the flaming sword
      guarding that tree still, or was it destroyed, or did its rotting trunk,
      as the Rev. Robert Collyer suggests, "nourish a bank of violets"?
    </p>
<p>
      What objection could God have had to the immortality of man? You see that
      after all, this sacred record, instead of assuring us of immortality,
      shows us only how we lost it. In this there is assuredly but little
      consolation.
    </p>
<p>
      According to this story we have lost one Eden, but nowhere in the Mosaic
      books are we told how we may gain another. I know that the Christians tell
      us there is another, in which all true believers will finally be gathered,
      and enjoy the unspeakable happiness of seeing the unbelievers in hell; but
      they do not tell us where it is.
    </p>
<p>
      Some commentators say that the Garden of Eden was in the third heaven—some
      in the fourth, others have located it in the moon, some in the air beyond
      the attraction of the earth, some on the earth, some under the earth, some
      inside the earth, some at the North Pole, others at the South, some in
      Tartary, some in China, some on the borders of the Ganges, some in the
      island of Ceylon, some in Armenia, some in Africa, some under the Equator,
      others in Mesopotamia, in Syria, Persia, Arabia, Babylon, Assyria,
      Palestine and Europe. Others have contended that it was invisible, that it
      was an allegory, and must be spiritually understood.
    </p>
<p>
      But whether you understand these things or not, you must believe them. You
      may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into a
      deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
      crowned and glorified in the next. You will also have the pleasure of
      hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here. While you will
      not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to smilingly
      express your entire acquiescence in the will of God. But where is the new
      Eden? No one knows. The one was lost, and the other has not been found.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it true that man was once perfectly pure and innocent, and that he
      became degenerate by disobedience? No. The real truth is, and the history
      of man shows, that he has advanced. Events, like the pendulum of a clock
      have swung forward and back ward, but after all, man, like the hands, has
      gone steadily on. Man is growing grander. He is not degenerating. Nations
      and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms. The
      intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass. Ideals
      grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy becomes
      less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the years sweep
      on. The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are behind us and
      the real Eden is beyond. It is said that a desire for knowledge lost us
      the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not, it will certainly
      give us the Eden of the future.
    </p>
<p>
      XVII. THE FALL.
    </p>
<p>
      We are told that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field,
      that he had a conversation with Eve, in which he gave his opinion about
      the effect of eating certain fruit; that he assured her it was good to
      eat, that it was pleasant to the eye, that it would make her wise; that
      she was induced to take some; that she persuaded her husband to try it;
      that God found it out, that he then cursed the snake; condemning it to
      crawl and eat the dust; that he multiplied the sorrows of Eve, cursed the
      ground for Adam's sake, started thistles and thorns, condemned man to eat
      the herb of the field in the sweat of his face, pronounced the curse of
      death, "Dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return," made coats of
      skins for Adam and Eve, and drove them out of Eden.
    </p>
<p>
      Who, and what was this serpent? Dr. Adam Clarke says:—"The serpent
      must have walked erect, for this is necessarily implied in his punishment.
      That he was endued with the gift of speech, also with reason. That these
      things were given to this creature. The woman no doubt having often seen
      him walking erect, and talking and reasoning, therefore she testifies no
      sort of surprise when he accosts her in the language related in the text.
      It therefore appears to me that a creature of the ape or orangoutang kind
      is here intended, and that Satan made use of this creature as the most
      proper instrument for the accomplishment of his murderous purposes against
      the life of the soul of man. Under this creature he lay hid, and by this
      creature he seduced our first parents. Such a creature answers to every
      part of the description in the text. It is evident from the structure of
      its limbs and its muscles that it might have been originally designed to
      walk erect, and that nothing else than the sovereign controlling power
      could induce it to put down hands—in every respect formed like those
      of man—and walk like those creatures whose claw-armed parts prove
      them to have been designed to walk on all fours. The stealthy cunning, and
      endless variety of the pranks and tricks of these creatures show them even
      now to be wiser and more intelligent than any other creature, man alone
      excepted. Being obliged to walk on all fours and gather their food from
      the ground, they are literally obliged to eat the dust; and though
      exceeding cunning, and careful in a variety of instances to separate that
      part which is wholesome and proper for food from that which is not so, in
      the article of cleanliness they are lost to all sense of propriety. Add to
      this their utter aversion to walk upright; it requires the utmost
      discipline to bring them to it, and scarcely anything offends or irritates
      them more than to be obliged to do it. Long observation of these animals
      enables me to state these facts. For earnest, attentive watching, and for
      chattering and babbling they (the ape) have no fellows in the animal
      world. Indeed, the ability and propensity to chatter, is all they have
      left of their original gift of speech, of which they appear to have been
      deprived at the fall as a part of their punishment."
    </p>
<p>
      Here then is the "connecting link" between man and the lower creation. The
      serpent was simply an orang-outang that spoke Hebrew with the greatest
      ease, and had the outward appearance of a perfect gentleman, seductive in
      manner, plausible, polite, and most admirably calculated to deceive.
    </p>
<p>
      It never did seem reasonable' to me that a long, cold and disgusting snake
      with an apple in his mouth, could deceive anybody; and I am glad, even at
      this late date to know that the something that persuaded Eve to taste the
      forbidden fruit was, at least, in the shape of a man.
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Henry does not agree with the zoological explanation of Mr. Clark, but
      insists that "it is certain that the devil that beguiled Eve is the old
      serpent, a malignant by creation, an angel of light, an immediate
      attendant upon God's throne, but by sin an apostate from his first state,
      and a rebel against God's crown and dignity. He who attacked our first
      parents was surely the prince of devils, the ring leader in rebellion. The
      devil chose to act his part in a serpent, because it is a specious
      creature, has a spotted, dappled skin, and then, went erect. Perhaps it
      was a flying serpent which seemed to come from on high, as a messenger
      from the upper world, one of the seraphim; because the serpent is a
      subtile creature. What Eve thought of this serpent speaking to her, we are
      not likely to tell, and, I believe, she herself did not know what to think
      of it. At first, perhaps, she supposed it might be a good angel, and yet
      afterwards might suspect something amiss. The person tempted was a woman,
      now alone, and at a distance from her husband, but near the forbidden
      tree. It was the devil's subtlety to assault the weaker vessel with his
      temptations, as we may suppose her inferior to Adam in knowledge, strength
      and presence of mind. Some think that Eve received the command not
      immediately from God, but at second hand from her husband, and might,
      therefore, be the more easily persuaded to discredit it. It was the policy
      of the devil to enter into discussion with her when she was alone. He took
      advantage by finding her near the forbidden tree. God permitted Satan to
      prevail over Eve, for wise and holy ends. Satan teaches men first to
      doubt, and then to deny. He makes skeptics first, and by degrees makes
      them atheists."
    </p>
<p>
      We are compelled to admit that nothing could be more attractive to a woman
      than a snake walking erect, with a "spotted, dappled skin," unless it were
      a serpent with wings. Is it not humiliating to know that our ancestors
      believed these things? Why should we object to the Darwinian doctrine of
      descent after this?
    </p>
<p>
      Our fathers thought it their duty to believe, thought it a sin to
      entertain the slightest doubt, and really supposed that their credulity
      was exceedingly, gratifying to God. To them, the story was entirely real.
      They could see the garden, hear the babble of waters, smell the perfume of
      flowers. They believed there was a tree where knowledge grew like plums or
      pears; and they could plainly see the serpent coiled amid its rustling
      leaves, coaxing Eve to violate the laws of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Where did the serpent come from? On which of the six days was he created?
      Who made him? Is it possible that God would make a successful rival? He
      must have known that Adam and Eve would fall. He knew what a snake with a
      "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced woman. Why did he
      not defend his children? He knew that if the serpent got into the garden,
      Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive them out, that
      afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he himself would die
      upon the cross.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, I ask what and who was this serpent? He was not a man, for only one
      man had been made. He was not a woman. He was not a beast of the field,
      because "he was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord
      God had made." He was neither fish nor fowl, nor snake, because he had the
      power of speech, and did not crawl upon his belly until after he was
      cursed. Where did this serpent come from? Why was he not kept out of the
      garden? Why did not the Lord God take him by the tail and snap his head
      off? Why did he not put Adam and Eve on their guard about this serpent?
      They, of course, were not acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing
      about the serpent's reputation for truth and veracity among his neighbors.
      Probably Adam saw him when he was looking for "an helpmeet" and gave him a
      name, but Eve had never met him before. She was not surprised to hear a
      serpent talk, as that was the first one she had ever met. Every thing
      being new to her, and her husband not being with her just at that moment,
      it need hardly excite our wonder that she tasted the fruit by way of
      experiment. Neither should we be surprised that when she saw it was good
      and pleasant to the eye, and a fruit to be desired to make one wise, she
      had the generosity to divide with her husband.
    </p>
<p>
      Theologians have filled thousands of volumes with abuse of this serpent,
      but it seems that he told the exact truth. We are told that this serpent
      was, in fact, Satan, the greatest enemy of mankind, and that he entered
      the serpent, appearing to our first parents in its body. If this is so,
      why should the serpent have been cursed? Why should God curse the serpent
      for what had really been done by the devil? Did Satan remain in the body
      of the serpent, and in some mysterious manner share his punishment? Is it
      true that when we kill a snake we also destroy an evil spirit, or is there
      but one devil, and did he perish at the death of the first serpent? Is it
      on account of that transaction in the Garden of Eden, that all the
      descendants of Adam and Eve known as Jews and Christians hate serpents?
    </p>
<p>
      Do you account for the snake-worship in Mexico, Africa and India in the
      same way?
    </p>
<p>
      What was the form of the serpent when he entered the garden, and in what
      way did he move from place to place? Did he walk or fly? Certainly he did
      not crawl, because that mode of locomotion was pronounced upon him as a
      curse. Upon what food did he subsist before his conversation with Eve? We
      know that after that he lived upon dust, but what did he eat before? It
      may be that this is all poetic; and the truest poetry is, according to
      Touchstone, "the most feigning."
    </p>
<p>
      In this same chapter we are informed that "unto Adam also and to his wife
      did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them." Where did the Lord
      God get those skins? He must have taken them from the animals; he was a
      butcher. Then he had to prepare them; he was a tanner. Then he made them
      into coats; he was a tailor. How did it happen that they needed coats of
      skins, when they had been perfectly comfortable in a nude condition? Did
      the "fall" produce a change in the climate?
    </p>
<p>
      Is it really necessary to believe this account in order to be happy here,
      or hereafter? Does it tend to the elevation of the human race to speak of
      "God" as a butcher, tanner and tailor?
    </p>
<p>
      And here, let me say once for all, that when I speak of God, I mean the
      being described by Moses; the Jehovah of the Jews. There may be for aught
      I know, somewhere in the unknown shoreless vast, some being whose dreams
      are constellations and within whose thought the infinite exists. About
      this being, if such an one exists, I have nothing to say. He has written
      no books, inspired no barbarians, required no worship, and has prepared no
      hell in which to burn the honest seeker after truth.
    </p>
<p>
      When I speak of God, I mean that god who prevented man from putting forth
      his hand and taking also of the fruit of the tree of life that he might
      live forever; of that god who multiplied the agonies of woman, increased
      the weary toil of man, and in his anger drowned a world—of that god
      whose altars reeked with human blood, who butchered babes, violated
      maidens, enslaved men and filled the earth with cruelty and crime; of that
      god who made heaven for the few, hell for the many, and who will gloat
      forever and ever upon the writhings of the lost and damned.
    </p>
<p>
      XVIII. DAMPNESS.
    </p>
<p>
      "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth,
      and daughters were born unto them.
    </p>
<p>
      "That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and
      they took them wives of all which they chose.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that
      he also is flesh; yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.

      "There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that when
      the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children
      to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
    </p>
<p>
      "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that
      every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
    </p>
<p>
      "And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it
      grieved him at his heart.
    </p>
<p>
      "And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face
      of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls
      of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them."
    </p>
<p>
      From this account it seems that driving Adam and Eve out of Eden did not
      have the effect to improve them or their children. On the contrary, the
      world grew worse and worse. They were under the immediate control and
      government of God, and he from time to time made known his will; but in
      spite of this, man continued to increase in crime.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing in particular seems to have been done. Not a school was
      established. There was no written language. There was not a Bible in the
      world. The "scheme of salvation" was kept a profound secret. The five
      points of Calvinism had not been taught. Sunday schools had not been
      opened. In short, nothing had been done for the reformation of the world.
      God did not even keep his own sons at home, but allowed them to leave
      their abode in the firmament, and make love to the daughters of men. As a
      result of this, the world was filled with wickedness and giants to such an
      extent that God regretted "that he had made man on the earth, and it
      grieved him at his heart."
    </p>
<p>
      Of course God knew when he made man, that he would afterwards regret it.
      He knew that the people would grow worse and worse until destruction would
      be the only remedy. He knew that he would have to kill all except Noah and
      his family, and it is hard to see why he did not make Noah and his family
      in the first place, and leave Adam and Eve in the original dust. He knew
      that they would be tempted, that he would have to drive them out of the
      garden to keep them from eating of the tree of life; that the whole thing
      would be a failure; that Satan would defeat his plan; that he could not
      reform the people; that his own sons would corrupt them, and that at last
      he would have to drown them all except Noah and his family. Why was the
      Garden of Eden planted? Why was the experiment made? Why were Adam and Eve
      exposed to the seductive arts of the serpent? Why did God wait until the
      cool of the day before looking after his children? Why was he not on hand
      in the morning?
    </p>
<p>
      Why did he fill the world with his own children, knowing that he would
      have to destroy them? And why does this same God tell me how to raise my
      children when he had to drown his?
    </p>
<p>
      It is a little curious that when God wished to reform the ante-diluvian
      world he said nothing about hell; that he had no revivals, no
      camp-meetings, no tracts, no outpourings of the Holy Ghost, no baptisms,
      no noon prayer meetings, and never mentioned the great doctrine of
      salvation by faith. If the orthodox creeds of the world are true, all
      those people went to hell without ever having heard that such a place
      existed. If eternal torment is a fact, surely these miserable wretches
      ought to have been warned. They were threatened only with water when they
      were in fact doomed to eternal fire!
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not strange that God said nothing to Adam and Eve about a future
      life; that he should have kept these "infinite verities" to himself and
      allowed millions to live and die without the hope of heaven, or the fear
      of hell?
    </p>
<p>
      It may be that hell was not made at that time. In the six days of creation
      nothing is said about the construction of a bottomless pit, and the
      serpent himself did not make his appearance until after the creation of
      man and woman. Perhaps he was made on the first Sunday, and from that fact
      came, it may be, the old couplet,
    </p>
<pre>
     "And Satan still some mischief finds
     For idle hands to do."
</pre>
<p>
      The sacred historian failed also to tell us when the cherubim and the
      flaming sword were made, and said nothing about two of the persons
      composing the Trinity. It certainly would have been an easy thing to
      enlighten Adam and his immediate descendants. The world was then only
      about fifteen hundred and thirty-six years old, and only about three or
      four generations of men had lived. Adam had been dead only about six
      hundred and six years, and some of his grandchildren must, at that time,
      have been alive and well.
    </p>
<p>
      It is hard to see why God did not civilize these people. He certainly had
      the power to use, and the wisdom to devise the proper means. What right
      has a god to fill a world with fiends? Can there be goodness in this? Why
      should he make experiments that he knows must fail? Is there wisdom in
      this? And what right has a man to charge an infinite being with wickedness
      and folly?
    </p>
<p>
      According to Moses, God made up his mind not only to destroy the people,
      but the beasts and the creeping things, and the fowls of the air. What had
      the beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds done to excite the
      anger of God? Why did he repent having made them? Will some Christian give
      us an explanation of this matter? No good man will inflict unnecessary
      pain upon a beast; how then can we worship a god who cares nothing for the
      agonies of the dumb creatures that he made?
    </p>
<p>
      Why did he make animals that he knew he would destroy? Does God delight in
      causing pain? He had the power to make the beasts, and fowls, and creeping
      things in his own good time and way, and it is to be presumed that he made
      them according to his wish. Why should he destroy them? They had committed
      no sin. They had eaten no forbidden fruit, made no aprons, nor tried to
      reach the tree of life. Yet this god, in blind unreasoning wrath destroyed
      "all flesh wherein was the breath of life, and every living thing beneath
      the sky, and every substance wherein was life that he had made."
    </p>
<p>
      Jehovah having made up his mind to drown the world, told Noah to make an
      Ark of gopher wood three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty
      cubits high. A cubit is twenty-two inches; so that the ark was five
      hundred and fifty feet long, ninety-one feet and eight inches wide and
      fifty-five feet high. This ark was divided into three stories, and had on
      top, one window twenty-two inches square. Ventilation must have been one
      of Jehovah's hobbies. Think of a ship larger than the Great Eastern with
      only one window, and that but twenty-two inches square!
    </p>
<p>
      The ark also had one door set in the side thereof that shut from the
      outside. As soon as this ship was finished, and properly victualed, Noah
      received seven days notice to get the animals in the ark.
    </p>
<p>
      It is claimed by some of the scientific theologians that the flood was
      partial, that the waters covered only a small portion of the world, and
      that consequently only a few animals were in the ark. It is impossible to
      conceive of language that can more clearly convey the idea of a universal
      flood than that found in the inspired account. If the flood was only
      partial, why did God say he would "destroy all flesh wherein is the breath
      of life from under heaven, and that every thing that is in the earth shall
      die"? Why did he say "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face
      of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping thing and the fowls of
      the air"? Why did he say "And every living substance that I have made will
      I destroy from off the face of the earth"? Would a partial, local flood
      have fulfilled these threats?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can be clearer than that the writer of this account intended to
      convey, and did convey the idea that the flood was universal. Why should
      Christians try to deprive God of the glory of having wrought the most
      stupendous of miracles? Is it possible that the Infinite could not
      overwhelm with waves this atom called the earth? Do you doubt his power,
      his wisdom or his justice?
    </p>
<p>
      Believers in miracles should not endeavor to explain them. There is but
      one way to explain anything, and that is to account for it by natural
      agencies. The moment you explain a miracle, it disappears. You should
      depend not upon explanation, but assertion. You should not be driven from
      the field because the miracle is shown to be unreasonable. You should
      reply that all miracles are unreasonable. Neither should you be in the
      least disheartened if it is shown to be impossible. The possible is not
      miraculous. You should take the ground that if miracles were reasonable,
      and possible, there would be no reward paid for believing them. The
      Christian has the goodness to believe, while the sinner asks for evidence.
      It is enough for God to work miracles without being called upon to
      substantiate them for the benefit of unbelievers.
    </p>
<p>
      Only a few years ago, the Christians believed implicitly in the literal
      truth of every miracle recorded in the Bible. Whoever tried to explain
      them in some natural way, was looked upon as an infidel in disguise, but
      now he is regarded as a benefactor. The credulity of the church is
      decreasing, and the most marvelous miracles are now either "explained," or
      allowed to take refuge behind the mistakes of the translators, or hide in
      the drapery of allegory.
    </p>
<p>
      In the sixth chapter, Noah is ordered to take "of every living thing of
      all flesh, two of every sort into the ark—male and female." In the
      seventh chapter the order is changed, and Noah is commanded, according to
      the Protestant Bible, as follows: "Of every clean beast thou shalt take to
      thee by sevens, the male and his female, and of beasts that are not clean,
      by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the
      male and the female."
    </p>
<p>
      According to the Catholic Bible, Noah was commanded—-"Of all clean
      beasts take seven and seven, the male and the female. But of the beasts
      that are unclean two and two, the male and the female. Of the fowls also
      of the air seven and seven, the male and the female."
    </p>
<p>
      For the purpose of belittling this miracle, many commentators have taken
      the ground that Noah was not ordered to take seven males and seven females
      of each kind of clean beasts, but seven in all. Many Christians contend
      that only seven clean beasts of each kind were taken into the ark—three
      and a half of each sex.
    </p>
<p>
      If the account in the seventh chapter means anything, it means <i>first</i>,
      that of each kind of clean beasts, fourteen were to be taken, seven males,
      and seven females; <i>second</i>, that of unclean beasts should be taken,
      two of each kind, one of each sex, and <i>third</i>, that he should take
      of every kind of fowls, seven of each sex.
    </p>
<p>
      It is equally clear that the command in the 19th and 20th verses of the
      6th chapter, is to take two of each sort, one male and one female. And
      this agrees exactly with the account in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 14th, 15th, and
      16th verses of the 7th chapter.
    </p>
<p>
      The next question is, how many beasts, fowls and creeping things did Noah
      take into the ark?
    </p>
<p>
      There are now known and classified at least twelve thousand five hundred
      species of birds. There are still vast territories in China, South
      America, and Africa unknown to the ornithologist.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the birds, Noah took fourteen of each species, according to the 3d
      verse of the 7th chapter, "Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male
      and the female," making a total of 175,000 birds.
    </p>
<p>
      And right here allow me to ask a question. If the flood was simply a
      partial flood, why were birds taken into the ark? It seems to me that most
      birds, attending strictly to business, might avoid a partial flood.
    </p>
<p>
      There are at least sixteen hundred and fifty-eight kinds of beasts. Let us
      suppose that twenty-five of these are clean. Of the clean, fourteen of
      each kind—seven of each sex—were taken. These amount to 350.
      Of the unclean—two of each kind, amounting to 3,266. There are some
      six hundred and fifty species of reptiles. Two of each kind amount to
      1,300. And lastly, there are of insects including the creeping things, at
      least one million species, so that Noah and his folks had to get of these
      into the ark about 2,000,000.
    </p>
<p>
      Animalculæ have not been taken into consideration. There are
      probably many hundreds of thousands of species; many of them invisible;
      and yet Noah had to pick them out by pairs. Very few people have any just
      conception of the trouble Noah had.
    </p>
<p>
      We know that there are many animals on this continent not found in the Old
      World. These must have been carried from here to the ark, and then brought
      back afterwards. Were the peccary, armadillo, ant-eater, sloth, agouti,
      vampire-bat, marmoset, howling and prehensile-tailed monkey, the raccoon
      and muskrat carried by the angels from America to Asia? How did they get
      there? Did the polar bear leave his field of ice and journey toward the
      tropics? How did he know where the ark was? Did the kangaroo swim or jump
      from Australia to Asia? Did the giraffe, hippopotamus, antelope and
      orang-outang journey from Africa in search of the ark? Can absurdities go
      farther than this?
    </p>
<p>
      What had these animals to eat while on the journey? What did they eat
      while in the ark? What did they drink? When the rain came, of course the
      rivers ran to the seas, and these seas rose and finally covered the world.
      The waters of the seas, mingled with those of the flood, would make all
      salt. It has been calculated that it required, to drown the world, about
      eight times as much water as was in all the seas. To find how salt the
      waters of the flood must have been, take eight quarts of fresh water, and
      add one quart from the sea. Such water would create instead of allaying
      thirst. Noah had to take in his ark fresh water for all his beasts, birds
      and living things. He had to take the proper food for all. How long was he
      in the ark? Three hundred and seventy-seven days! Think of the food
      necessary for the monsters of the ante-diluvian world!
    </p>
<p>
      Eight persons did all the work. They attended to the wants of 175,000
      birds, 3,616 beasts, 1,300 reptiles, and 2,000,000 insects, saying nothing
      of countless animalculæ.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, after they all got in, Noah pulled down the window, God shut the
      door, and the rain commenced.
    </p>
<p>
      How long did it rain?
    </p>
<p>
      Forty days.
    </p>
<p>
      How deep did the water get?
    </p>
<p>
      About five miles and a half.
    </p>
<p>
      How much did it rain a day?
    </p>
<p>
      Enough to cover the whole world to a depth of about seven hundred and
      forty-two feet.
    </p>
<p>
      Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.
      Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
      are? Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
      earth that he used on that occasion. How did these waters happen to run up
      hill?
    </p>
<p>
      Gentlemen, allow me to tell you once more that you must not try to explain
      these things. Your efforts in that direction do no good, because your
      explanations are harder to believe than the miracle itself. Take my
      advice, stick to assertion, and let explanation alone.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, as now, Dhawalagiri lifted its crown of snow twenty-nine thousand
      feet above the level of the sea, and on the cloudless cliffs of Chimborazo
      then, as now, sat the condor; and yet the waters rising seven hundred and
      twenty-six feet a day—thirty feet an hour, six inches a minute,—rose
      over the hills, over the volcanoes, filled the vast craters, extinguished
      all the fires, rose above every mountain peak until the vast world was but
      one shoreless sea covered with the innumerable dead.
    </p>
<p>
      Was this the work of the most merciful God, the father of us all? If there
      is a God, can there be the slightest danger of incurring his displeasure
      by doubting even in a reverential way, the truth of such a cruel lie? If
      we think that God is kinder than he really is, will our poor souls be
      burned for that?
    </p>
<p>
      How many trees can live under miles of water for a year? What became of
      the soil washed, scattered, dissolved, and covered with the <i>debris</i>
      of a world? How were the tender plants and herbs preserved? How were the
      animals preserved after leaving the ark? There was no grass except such as
      had been submerged for a year. There were no animals to be devoured by the
      carnivorous beasts. What became of the birds that fed on worms and
      insects? What became of the birds that devoured other birds?
    </p>
<p>
      It must be remembered that the pressure of the water when at the highest
      point—say twenty-nine thousand feet, would have been about eight
      hundred tons on each square foot. Such a pressure certainly would have
      destroyed nearly every vestige of vegetable life, so that when the animals
      came out of the ark, there was not a mouthful of food in the wide world.
      How were they supported until the world was again clothed with grass? How
      were those animals taken care of that subsisted on others? Where did the
      bees get honey, and the ants seeds? There was not a creeping thing upon
      the whole earth; not a breathing creature beneath the whole heavens; not a
      living substance. Where did the tenants of the ark get food?
    </p>
<p>
      There is but one answer, if the story is true. The food necessary not only
      during the year of the flood, but sufficient for many months afterwards,
      must have been stored in the ark.
    </p>
<p>
      There is probably not an animal in the world that will not, in a year, eat
      and drink ten times its weight. Noah must have provided food and water for
      a year while in the ark, and food for at least six months after they got
      ashore. It must have required for a pair of elephants, about one hundred
      and fifty tons of food and water. A couple of mammoths would have required
      about twice that amount. Of course there were other monsters that lived on
      trees; and in a year would have devoured quite a forest.
    </p>
<p>
      How could eight persons have distributed this food, even if the ark had
      been large enough to hold it? How was the ark kept clean? We know how it
      was ventilated; but what was done with the filth? How were the animals
      watered? How were some portions of the ark heated for animals from the
      tropics, and others kept cool for the polar bears? How did the animals get
      back to their respective countries? Some had to creep back about six
      thousand miles, and they could only go a few feet a day. Some of the
      creeping things must have started for the ark just as soon as they were
      made, and kept up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years. Think of a
      couple of the slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting
      for the plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles. Going at
      the rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years. How did
      they get there? Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and so
      sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon their
      health. How did they know the way to go? Of course, all the polar bears
      did not go. Only two were required. Who selected these?
    </p>
<p>
      Two sloths had to make the journey from South America. These creatures
      cannot travel to exceed three rods a day. At this rate, they would make a
      mile in about a hundred days. They must have gone about six thousand five
      hundred miles, to reach the ark. Supposing them to have traveled by a
      reasonably direct route, in order to complete the journey before Noah
      hauled in the plank, they must have started several years before the world
      was created. We must also consider that these sloths had to board
      themselves on the way, and that most of their time had to be taken up
      getting food and water. It is exceedingly doubtful whether a sloth could
      travel six thousand miles and board himself in less than three thousand
      years.
    </p>
<p>
      Volumes might be written upon the infinite absurdity of this most
      incredible, wicked and foolish of all the fables contained in that
      repository of the impossible, called the Bible. To me it is a matter of
      amazement, that it ever was for a moment believed by any intelligent human
      being.
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Adam Clarke says that "the animals were brought to the ark by the
      power of God, and their enmities were so removed or suspended, that the
      lion could dwell peaceably with the lamb, and the wolf sleep happily by
      the side of the kid. There is no positive evidence that animal food was
      ever used before the flood. Noah had the first grant of this kind."
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Scott remarks, "There seems to have been a very extraordinary miracle,
      perhaps by the ministration of angels, in bringing two of every species to
      Noah, and rendering them submissive, and peaceful with each other. Yet it
      seems not to have made any impression upon the hardened spectators. The
      suspension of the ferocity of the savage beasts during their continuance
      in the ark, is generally considered as an apt figure of the change that
      takes place in the disposition of sinners when they enter the true church
      of Christ."
    </p>
<p>
      He believed the deluge to have been universal. In his day science had not
      demonstrated the absurdity of this belief, and he was not compelled to
      resort to some theory not found in the Bible. He insisted that "by some
      vast convulsion, the very bowels of the earth were forced upwards, and
      rain poured down in cataracts and water-spouts, with no intermission for
      forty days and nights, and until in every place a universal deluge was
      effected.
    </p>
<p>
      "The presence of God was the only comfort of Noah in his dreary
      confinement, and in witnessing the dire devastation of the earth and its
      inhabitants, and especially of the human species—of his companions,
      his neighbors, his relatives—all those to whom he had preached, for
      whom he had prayed and over whom he had wept, and even of many who had
      helped to build the ark.
    </p>
<p>
      "It seems that by a peculiar providential interposition, no animal of any
      sort died, although they had been shut up in the ark above a year; and it
      does not appear that there had been any increase of them during that time.
    </p>
<p>
      "The Ark was flat-bottomed—square at each end—roofed like a
      house so that it terminated at the top in the breadth of a cubit. It was
      divided into many little cabins for its intended inhabitants. Pitched
      within and without to keep it tight and sweet, and lighted from the upper
      part. But it must, at first sight, be evident that so large a vessel, thus
      constructed, with so few persons on board, was utterly unfitted to weather
      out the deluge, except it was under the immediate guidance and protection
      of the Almighty."
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Henry furnished the Christian world with the following:—
    </p>
<p>
      "As our bodies have in them the humors which, when God pleases, become the
      springs and seeds of mortal disease, so the earth had, in its bowels,
      those waters which, at God's command, sprung up and flooded it.
    </p>
<p>
      "God made the world in six days, but he was forty days in destroying it,
      because he is slow to anger.
    </p>
<p>
      "The hostilities between the animals in the ark ceased, and ravenous
      creatures became mild and manageable, so that the wolf lay down with the
      lamb, and the lion ate straw like an ox.
    </p>
<p>
      "God shut the door of the ark to secure Noah and to keep him safe, and
      because it was necessary that the door should be shut very close lest the
      water should break in and sink the ark, and very fast lest others might
      break it down.
    </p>
<p>
      "The waters rose so high that not only the low flat countries were
      deluged, but to make sure work and that none might escape, the tops of the
      highest mountains were overflowed fifteen cubits. That is, seven and a
      half yards, so that salvation was not hoped for from hills or mountains.
    </p>
<p>
      "Perhaps some of the people got to the top of the ark, and hoped to shift
      for themselves there. But either they perished there for want of food, or
      the dashing rain washed them off the top. Others, it may be, hoped to
      prevail with Noah for admission into the ark, and plead old acquaintance.
    </p>
<p>
      "'Have we not eaten and drank in thy presence? Hast thou not preached in
      our streets?' 'Yea,' said Noah, 'many a time, but to little purpose. I
      called but ye refused; and now it is not in my power to help you. God has
      shut the door and I cannot open it.'
    </p>
<p>
      "We may suppose that some of those who perished in the deluge had
      themselves assisted Noah, or were employed by him in building the ark.
    </p>
<p>
      "Hitherto, man had been confined to feed only upon the products of the
      earth. Fruits, herbs and roots, and all sorts of greens, and milk, which
      was the first grant; but the flood having perhaps washed away much of the
      fruits of the earth, and rendered them much less pleasant and nourishing,
      God enlarged the grant and allowed him to eat flesh, which perhaps man
      never thought of until now, that God directed him to it. Nor had he any
      more desire to it than the sheep has to suck blood like the wolf. But now,
      man is allowed to feed upon flesh as freely and safely as upon the green
      herb."
    </p>
<p>
      Such was the debasing influence of a belief in the literal truth of the
      Bible upon these men, that their commentaries are filled with passages
      utterly devoid of common sense.
    </p>
<p>
      Dr. Clarke speaking of the mammoth says:
    </p>
<p>
      "This animal, an astonishing proof of God's power, he seems to have
      produced merely to show what he could do. And after suffering a few of
      them to propagate, he extinguished the race by a merciful providence, that
      they might not destroy both man and beast.
    </p>
<p>
      "We are told that it would have been much easier for God to destroy all
      the people and make new ones, but he would not want to waste anything and
      no power or skill should be lavished where no necessity exists.
    </p>
<p>
      "The animals were brought to the ark by the power of God."
    </p>
<p>
      Again gentlemen, let me warn you of the danger of trying to explain a
      miracle. Let it alone. Say that you do not understand it, and do not
      expect to until taught in the schools of the New Jerusalem. The more
      reasons you give, the more unreasonable the miracle will appear. Through
      what you say in defence, people are led to think, and as soon as they
      really think, the miracle is thrown away.
    </p>
<p>
      Among the most ignorant nations you will find the most wonders, among the
      most enlightened, the least. It is with individuals, the same as with
      nations. Ignorance believes, Intelligence examines and explains.
    </p>
<p>
      For about seven months the ark, with its cargo of men, animals and
      insects, tossed and wandered without rudder or sail upon a boundless sea.
      At last it grounded on the mountains of Ararat; and about three months
      afterward the tops of the mountains became visible. It must not be
      forgotten that the mountain where the ark is supposed to have first
      touched bottom, was about seventeen thousand feet high. How were the
      animals from the tropics kept warm? When the waters were abated it would
      be intensely cold at a point seventeen thousand feet above the level of
      the sea. May be there were stoves, furnaces, fire places and steam coils
      in the ark, but they are not mentioned in the inspired narrative. How were
      the animals kept from freezing? It will not do to say that Ararat was not
      very high after all.
    </p>
<p>
      If you will read the fourth and fifth verses of the eight chapter you will
      see that although "the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
      day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat, it was not until the first
      day of the tenth month that the tops of the mountains could be seen." From
      this it would seem that the ark must have rested upon about the highest
      peak in that country. Noah waited forty days more, and then for the first
      time opened the window and took a breath of fresh air. He then sent out a
      raven that did not return, then a dove that returned. He then waited seven
      days and sent forth a dove that returned not. From this he knew that the
      waters were abated. Is it possible that he could not see whether the
      waters had gone? Is it possible to conceive of a more perfectly childish
      way of ascertaining whether the earth was dry?
    </p>
<p>
      At last Noah "removed the covering of the ark, and looked and behold the
      face of the ground was dry," and thereupon God told him to disembark. In
      his gratitude Noah built an altar and took of every clean beast and of
      every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings. And the Lord smelled a
      sweet savor and said in his heart that he would not any more curse the
      ground for man's sake. For saying this in his heart the Lord gives as a
      reason, not that man is, or will be good, but because "the imagination of
      man's heart is evil from his youth." God destroyed man because "the
      wickedness of man was great in the earth, and <i>because every imagination
      of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually</i>." And he
      promised for the same reason not to destroy him again. Will some gentleman
      skilled in theology give us an explanation?
    </p>
<p>
      After God had smelled the sweet savor of sacrifice, he seems to have
      changed his idea as to the proper diet for man. When Adam and Eve were
      created they were allowed to eat herbs bearing seed, and the fruit of
      trees. When they were turned out of Eden, God said to them "Thou shalt eat
      the herb of the field." In the first chapter of Genesis the "green herb"
      was given for food to the beasts, fowls and creeping things. Upon being
      expelled from the garden, Adam and Eve, as to their food, were put upon an
      equality with the lower animals. According to this, the ante-diluvians
      were vegetarians. This may account for their wickedness and longevity.
    </p>
<p>
      After Noah sacrificed, and God smelled the sweet savor; he said—"Every
      moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you, even as the green herb
      have I given you all things." Afterward this same God changed his mind
      again, and divided the beasts and birds into clean and unclean, and made
      it a crime for man to eat the unclean. Probably food was so scarce when
      Noah was let out of the ark that Jehovah generously allowed him to eat
      anything and everything he could find.
    </p>
<p>
      According to the account, God then made a covenant with Noah to the effect
      that he would not again destroy the world with a flood, and as the
      attesting witness of this contract, a rainbow was set in the cloud. This
      bow was placed in the sky so that it might perpetually remind God of his
      promise and covenant. Without this visible witness and reminder, it would
      seem that Jehovah was liable to forget the contract, and drown the world
      again. Did the rainbow originate in this way? Did God put it in the cloud
      simply to keep his agreement in his memory?
    </p>
<p>
      For me it is impossible to believe the story of the deluge. It seems so
      cruel, so barbaric, so crude in detail, so absurd in all its parts, and so
      contrary to all we know of law, that even credulity itself is shocked.
    </p>
<p>
      Many nations have preserved accounts of a deluge in which all people,
      except a family or two, were destroyed. Babylon was certainly a city
      before Jerusalem was founded. Egypt was in the height of her power when
      there were only seventy Jews in the world, and India had a literature
      before the name of Jehovah had passed the lips of superstition. An account
      of a general deluge "was discovered by George Smith, translated from
      another account that was written about two thousand years before Christ."
      Of course it is impossible to tell how long the story had lived in the
      memory of tradition before it was reduced to writing by the Babylonians.
      According to this account, which is, without doubt, much older than the
      one given by Moses, Tamzi built a ship at the command of the god Hea, and
      put in it his family and the beasts of the field. He pitched the ship
      inside and outside with bitumen, and as soon as it was finished, there
      came a flood of rain and "destroyed all life from the face of the whole
      earth. On the seventh day there was a calm, and the ship stranded on the
      mountain Nizir." Tamzi waited for seven days more, and then let out a
      dove. Afterwards, he let out a swallow, and that, as well as the dove
      returned. Then he let out a raven, and as that did not return, he
      concluded that the water had dried away, and thereupon left the ship. Then
      he made an offering to god, or the gods, and "Hea interceded with Bel," so
      that the earth might never again be drowned.
    </p>
<p>
      This is the Babylonian story, told without the contradictions of the
      original. For in that, it seems, there are two accounts, as well as in the
      Bible. Is it not a strange coincidence that there should be contradictory
      accounts mingled in both the Babylonian and Jewish stories?
    </p>
<p>
      In the Bible there are two accounts. In one account, Noah was to take two
      of all beasts, birds, and creeping things into the ark, while in the
      other, he was commanded to take of clean beasts, and all birds by sevens
      of each kind. According to one account, the flood only lasted one hundred
      and fifty days—as related in the third verse of the eighth chapter;
      while the other account fixes the time at three hundred and seventy-seven
      days. Both of these accounts cannot be true. Yet in order to be saved, it
      is not sufficient to believe one of them—you must believe both.
    </p>
<p>
      Among the Egyptians there was a story to the effect that the great god Ra
      became utterly maddened with the people, and deliberately made up his mind
      that he would exterminate mankind. Thereupon he began to destroy, and
      continued in the terrible work until blood flowed in streams, when
      suddenly he ceased, and took an oath that he would not again destroy the
      human race. This myth was probably thousands of years old when Moses was
      born.
    </p>
<p>
      So, in India, there was a fable about the flood. A fish warned Manu that a
      flood was coming. Manu built a "box" and the fish towed it to a mountain
      and saved all hands.
    </p>
<p>
      The same kind of stories were told in Greece, and among our own Indian
      tribes. At one time the Christian pointed to the fact that many nations
      told of a flood, as evidence of the truth of the Mosaic account; but now,
      it having been shown that other accounts are much older, and equally
      reasonable, that argument has ceased to be of any great value.
    </p>
<p>
      It is probable that all these accounts had a common origin. They were
      likely born of something in nature visible to all nations. The idea of a
      universal flood, produced by a god to drown the world on account of the
      sins of the people, is infinitely absurd. The solution of all these
      stories has been supposed to be, the existence of partial floods in most
      countries; and for a long time this solution was satisfactory. But the
      fact that these stories are greatly alike, that only one man is warned,
      that only one family is saved, that a boat is built, that birds are sent
      out to find if the water had abated, tend to show that they had a common
      origin. Admitting that there were severe floods in all countries; it
      certainly cannot follow that in each instance only one family would be
      saved, or that the same story would in each instance be told. It may be
      urged that the natural tendency of man to exaggerate calamities, might
      account for this agreement in all the accounts, and it must be admitted
      that there is some force in the suggestion. I believe, though, that the
      real origin of all these myths is the same, and that it was originally an
      effort to account for the sun, moon and stars. The sun and moon were the
      man and wife, or the god and goddess, and the stars were their children.
      From a celestial myth, it became a terrestrial one; the air, or
      ether-ocean became a flood, produced by rain, and the sun moon and stars
      became man, woman and children.
    </p>
<p>
      In the original story, the mountain was the place where in the far east
      the sky was supposed to touch the earth, and it was there that the ship
      containing the celestial passengers finally rested from its voyage. But
      whatever may be the origin of the stories of the flood, whether told first
      by Hindu, Babylonian or Hebrew, we may rest perfectly assured that they
      are all equally false.
    </p>
<p>
      XIX. BACCHUS AND BABEL.
    </p>
<p>
      As soon as Noah had disembarked, he proceeded to plant a vineyard, and
      began to be a husbandman; and when the grapes were ripe he made wine and
      drank of it to excess; cursed his grandson, blessed Shem and Japheth, and
      after that lived for three hundred and fifty years. What he did during
      these three hundred and fifty years, we are not told. We never hear of him
      again. For three hundred and fifty years he lived among his sons, and
      daughters, and their descendants. He must have been a venerable man. He
      was the man to whom God had made known his intention of drowning the
      world. By his efforts, the human race had been saved. He must have been
      acquainted with Methuselah for six hundred years, and Methuselah was about
      two hundred and forty years old, when Adam died. Noah must himself have
      known the history of mankind, and must have been an object of almost
      infinite interest; and yet for three hundred and fifty years he is neither
      directly nor indirectly mentioned. When Noah died, Abraham must have been
      more than fifty years old; and Shem, the son of Noah, lived for several
      hundred years after the death of Abraham; and yet he is never mentioned.
      Noah when he died, was the oldest man in the whole world by about five
      hundred years; and everybody living at the time of his death knew that
      they were indebted to him, and yet no account is given of his burial. No
      monument was raised to mark the spot. This, however, is no more wonderful
      than the fact that no account is given of the death of Adam or of Eve, nor
      of the place of their burial. This may all be accounted for by the fact
      that the language of man was confounded at the building of the tower of
      Babel, whereby all tradition may have been lost, so that even the sons of
      Noah could not give an account of their voyage in the ark; and,
      consequently, some one had to be directly inspired to tell the story,
      after new languages had been formed.
    </p>
<p>
      It has always been a mystery to me how Adam, Eve, and the serpent were
      taught the same language. Where did they get it? We know now, that it
      requires a great number of years to form a language; that it is of
      exceedingly slow growth. We also know that by language, man conveys to his
      fellows the impressions made upon him by what he sees, hears, smells and
      touches. We know that the language of the savage consists of a few sounds,
      capable of expressing only a few ideas or states of the mind, such as
      love, desire, fear, hatred, aversion and contempt. Many centuries are
      required to produce a language capable of expressing complex ideas. It
      does not seem to me that ideas can be manufactured by a deity and put in
      the brain of man. These ideas must be the result of observation and
      experience.
    </p>
<p>
      Does anybody believe that God directly taught a language to Adam and Eve,
      or that he so made them that they, by intuition spoke Hebrew, or some
      language capable of conveying to each other their thoughts? How did the
      serpent learn the same language? Did God teach it to him, or did he happen
      to overhear God, when he was teaching Adam and Eve? We are told in the
      second chapter of Genesis that God caused all the animals to pass before
      Adam to see what he would call them. We cannot infer from this that God
      named the animals and informed Adam what to call them. Adam named them
      himself. Where did he get his words? We cannot imagine a man just made out
      of dust, without the experience of a moment, having the power to put his
      thoughts in language. In the first place, we cannot conceive of his having
      any thoughts until he has combined, through experience and observation,
      the impressions that nature had made upon him through the medium of his
      senses. We cannot imagine of his knowing anything, in the first instance,
      about different degrees of heat, nor about darkness, if he was made in the
      day-time, nor about light, if created at night, until the next morning.
      Before a man can have what we call thoughts, he must have had a little
      experience. Something must have happened to him before he can have a
      thought, and before he can express himself in language. Language is a
      growth, not a gift. We account now for the diversity of language by the
      fact that tribes and nations have had different experiences, different
      wants, different surroundings, and, one result of all these differences
      is, among other things, a difference in language. Nothing can be more
      absurd than to account for the different languages of the world by saying
      that the original language was confounded at the tower of Babel.
    </p>
<p>
      According to the Bible, up to the time of the building of that tower, the
      whole earth was of one language and of one speech, and would have so
      remained until the present time had not an effort been made to build a
      tower whose top should reach into heaven. Can any one imagine what
      objection God would have to the building of such a tower? And how could
      the confusion of tongues prevent its construction? How could language be
      confounded? It could be confounded only by the destruction of memory. Did
      God destroy the memory of mankind at that time, and if so, how? Did he
      paralyze that portion of the brain presiding over the organs of
      articulation, so that they could not speak the words, although they
      remembered them clearly, or did he so touch the brain that they could not
      hear? Will some theologian, versed in the machinery of the miraculous,
      tell us in what way God confounded the language of mankind?
    </p>
<p>
      Why would the confounding of the language make them separate? Why would
      they not stay together until they could understand each other? People will
      not separate, from weakness. When in trouble they come together and desire
      the assistance of each other. Why, in this instance, did they separate?
      What particular ones would naturally come together if nobody understood
      the language of any other person? Would it not have been just as hard to
      agree when and where to go, without any language to express the agreement,
      as to go on with the building of the tower?
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible that any one now believes that the whole world would be of
      one speech had the language not been confounded at Babel? Do we not know
      that every word was suggested in some way by the experience of men? Do we
      not know that words are continually dying, and continually being born;
      that every language has its cradle and its cemetery—its buds, its
      blossoms, its fruits and its withered leaves? Man has loved, enjoyed,
      hated, suffered and hoped, and all words have been born of these
      experiences.
    </p>
<p>
      Why did "the Lord come down to see the city and the tower"? Could he not
      see them from where he lived or from where he was? Where did he come down
      from? Did he come in the daytime, or in the night? We are taught now that
      God is everywhere; that he inhabits immensity; that he is in every atom,
      and in every star. If this is true, why did he "come down to see the city
      and the tower?" Will some theologian explain this?
    </p>
<p>
      After all, is it not much easier and altogether more reasonable to say
      that Moses was mistaken, that he knew little of the science of language,
      and that he guessed a great deal more than he investigated?
    </p>
<p>
      XX. FAITH IN FILTH.
    </p>
<p>
      No light whatever is shed upon what passed in the world after the
      confounding of language at Babel, until the birth of Abraham. But, before
      speaking of the history of the Jewish people, it may be proper for me to
      say that many things are recounted in Genesis, and other books attributed
      to Moses, of which I do not wish to speak. There are many pages of these
      books unfit to read, many stories not calculated, in my judgment, to
      improve the morals of mankind. I do not wish even to call the attention of
      my readers to these things, except in a general way. It is to be hoped
      that the time will come when such chapters and passages as cannot be read
      without leaving the blush of shame upon the cheek of modesty, will be left
      out, and not published as a part of the Bible. If there is a God, it
      certainly is blasphemous to attribute to him the authorship of pages too
      obscene, beastly and vulgar to be read in the presence of men and women.
    </p>
<p>
      The believers in the Bible are loud in their denunciation of what they are
      pleased to call the immoral literature of the world; and yet few books
      have been published containing more moral filth than this inspired word of
      God. These stories are not redeemed by a single flash of wit or humor.
      They never rise above the dull details of stupid vice. For one, I cannot
      afford to soil my pages with extracts from them; and all such portions of
      the Scriptures I leave to be examined, written upon, and explained by the
      clergy. Clergymen may know some way by which they can extract honey from
      these flowers. Until these passages are expunged from the Old Testament,
      it is not a fit book to be read by either old or young. It contains pages
      that no minister in the United States would read to his congregation for
      any reward whatever. There are chapters that no gentleman would read in
      the presence of a lady. There are chapters that no father would read to
      his child. There are narratives utterly unfit to be told; and the time
      will come when mankind will wonder that such a book was ever called
      inspired.
    </p>
<p>
      I know that in many books besides the Bible, there are immodest lines.
      Some of the greatest writers have soiled their pages with indecent words.
      We account for this by saying that the authors were human; that they
      catered to the taste and spirit of their times. We make excuses, but at
      the same time regret that in their works they left an impure word. But
      what shall we say of God? Is it possible that a being of infinite purity—the
      author of modesty, would smirch the pages of his book with stories lewd,
      licentious and obscene? If God is the author of the Bible, it is, of
      course, the standard by which all other books can, and should be measured.
      If the Bible is not obscene, what book is? Why should men be imprisoned
      simply for imitating God? The Christian world should never say another
      word against immoral books until it makes the inspired volume clean. These
      vile and filthy things were not written for the purpose of conveying and
      enforcing moral truth, but seem to have been written because the author
      loved an unclean thing. There is no moral depth below that occupied by the
      writer or publisher of obscene books, that stain with lust, the loving
      heart of youth. Such men should be imprisoned and their books destroyed.
      The literature of the world should be rendered decent, and no book should
      be published that cannot be read by, and in the hearing of the best and
      purest people. But as long as the Bible is considered as the work of God,
      it will be hard to make all men too good and pure to imitate it; and as
      long as it is imitated there will be vile and filthy books. The literature
      of our country will not be sweet and clean until the Bible ceases to be
      regarded as the production of a god.
    </p>
<p>
      We are continually told that the Bible is the very foundation of modesty
      and morality; while many of its pages are so immodest and immoral that a
      minister, for reading them in the pulpit, would be instantly denounced as
      an unclean wretch. Every woman would leave the church, and if the men
      stayed, it would be for the purpose of chastising the minister.
    </p>
<p>
      Is there any saving grace in hypocrisy? Will men become clean in speech by
      believing that God is unclean? Would it not be far better to admit that
      the Bible was written by barbarians in a barbarous, coarse and vulgar age?
      Would it not be safer to charge Moses with vulgarity, instead of God? Is
      it not altogether more probable that some ignorant Hebrew would write the
      vulgar words? The Christians tell me that God is the author of these vile
      and stupid things? I have examined the question to the best of my ability,
      and as to God my verdict is:—Not guilty. Faith should not rest in
      filth.
    </p>
<p>
      Every foolish and immodest thing should be expunged from the Bible. Let us
      keep the good. Let us preserve every great and splendid thought, every
      wise and prudent maxim, every just law, every elevated idea, and every
      word calculated to make man nobler and purer, and let us have the courage
      to throw the rest away. The souls of children should not be stained and
      soiled. The charming instincts of youth should not be corrupted and
      defiled. The girls and boys should not be taught that unclean words were
      uttered by "inspired" lips. Teach them that these words were born of
      savagery and lust. Teach them that the unclean is the unholy, and that
      only the pure is sacred.

      XXI. THE HEBREWS.
    </p>
<p>
      After language had been confounded and the people scattered, there
      appeared in the land of Canaan a tribe of Hebrews ruled by a chief or
      sheik called Abraham. They had a few cattle, lived in tents, practiced
      polygamy, wandered from place to place, and were the only folks in the
      whole world to whom God paid the slightest attention. At this time there
      were hundreds of cities in India filled with temples and palaces; millions
      of Egyptians worshiped Isis and Osiris, and had covered their land with
      marvelous monuments of industry, power and skill. But these civilizations
      were entirely neglected by the Deity, his whole attention being taken up
      with Abraham and his family.
    </p>
<p>
      It seems, from the account, that God and Abraham were intimately
      acquainted, and conversed frequently upon a great variety of subjects. By
      the twelfth chapter of Genesis it appears that he made the following
      promises to Abraham. "I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless
      thee, and make thy name great: and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will
      bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee."
    </p>
<p>
      After receiving this communication from the Almighty, Abraham went into
      the land of Canaan, and again God appeared to him and told him to take a
      heifer three years old, a goat of the same age, a sheep of equal
      antiquity, a turtle dove and a young pigeon. Whereupon Abraham killed the
      animals "and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against
      another." And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark,
      behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between the raw
      and bleeding meat. The killing of these animals was a preparation for
      receiving a visit from God. Should an American missionary in Central
      Africa find a negro chief surrounded by a butchered heifer, a goat and a
      sheep, with which to receive a communication from the infinite God, my
      opinion is, that the missionary would regard the proceeding as the direct
      result of savagery. And if the chief insisted that he had seen a smoking
      furnace and a burning lamp going up and down between the pieces of meat,
      the missionary would certainly conclude that the chief was not altogether
      right in his mind.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Bible is true, this same God told Abraham to take and sacrifice his
      only son, or rather the only son of his wife, and a murder would have been
      committed had not God, just at the right moment, directed him to stay his
      hand and take a sheep instead.
    </p>
<p>
      God made a great number of promises to Abraham, but few of them were ever
      kept. He agreed to make him the father of a great nation, but he did not.
      He solemnly promised to give him a great country, including all the land
      between the river of Egypt and the Euphrates, but he did not.
    </p>
<p>
      In due time Abraham passed away, and his son Isaac took his place at the
      head of the tribe. Then came Jacob, who "watered stock" and enriched
      himself with the spoil of Laban. Joseph was sold into Egypt by his jealous
      brethren, where he became one of the chief men of the kingdom, and in a
      few years his father and brothers left their own country and settled in
      Egypt. At this time there were seventy Hebrews in the world, counting
      Joseph and his children. They remained in Egypt two hundred and fifteen
      years. It is claimed by some that they were in that country for four
      hundred and thirty years. This is a mistake. Josephus says they were in
      Egypt two hundred and fifteen years, and this statement is sustained by
      the best biblical scholars of all denominations. According to the 17th
      verse of the 3rd chapter of Galatians, it was four hundred and thirty
      years from the time the promise was made to Abraham to the giving of the
      law, and as the Hebrews did not go to Egypt for two hundred and fifteen
      years after the making of the promise to Abraham, they could in no event
      have been in Egypt more than two hundred and fifteen years. In our Bible
      the 40th verse of the 12th chapter of Exodus, is as follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was
      four hundred and thirty years."
    </p>
<p>
      This passage does not say that the sojourning was all done in Egypt;
      neither does it say that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt four
      hundred and thirty years; but it does say that the sojourning of the
      children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
      The Vatican copy of the Septuagint renders the same passage as follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      "The sojourning of the children of Israel which they sojourned in Egypt,
      and in the land of Canaan, was four hundred and thirty years."
    </p>
<p>
      The Alexandrian version says:—"The sojourning of the children of
      Israel which they and their fathers sojourned in Egypt, and in the land of
      Canaan, was four hundred and thirty years."
    </p>
<p>
      And in the Samaritan Bible we have:—"The sojourning of the children
      of Israel and of their fathers which they sojourned in the land of Canaan,
      and in the land of Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years."
    </p>
<p>
      There were seventy souls when they went down into Egypt, and they remained
      two hundred and fifteen years, and at the end of that time they had
      increased to about three million. How do we know that there were three
      million at the end of two hundred and fifteen years? We know it because we
      are informed by Moses that "there were six hundred thousand men of war."
      Now, to each man of war, there must have been at least five other people.
      In every State in this Union there will be to each voter, five other
      persons at least, and we all know that there are always more voters than
      men of war. If there were six hundred thousand men of war, there must have
      been a population of at least three million. Is it possible that seventy
      people could increase to that extent in two hundred and fifteen years? You
      may say that it was a miracle; but what need was there of working a
      miracle? Why should God miraculously increase the number of slaves? If he
      wished miraculously to increase the population, why did he not wait until
      the people were free?
    </p>
<p>
      In 1776, we had in the American Colonies about three millions of people.
      In one hundred years we doubled four times: that is to say, six, twelve,
      twenty-four, forty-eight million,—our present population.
    </p>
<p>
      We must not forget that during all these years there has been pouring into
      our country a vast stream of emigration, and that this, taken in
      connection with the fact that our country is productive beyond all others,
      gave us only four doubles in one hundred years. Admitting that the Hebrews
      increased as rapidly without emigration as we, in this country, have with
      it, we will give to them four doubles each century, commencing with
      seventy people, and they would have, at the end of two hundred years, a
      population of seventeen thousand nine hundred and twenty. Giving them
      another double for the odd fifteen years and there would be, provided no
      deaths had occurred, thirty-five thousand eight hundred and forty people.
      And yet we are told that instead of having this number, they had increased
      to such an extent that they had six hundred thousand men of war; that is
      to say, a population of more than three millions?
    </p>
<p>
      Every sensible man knows that this account is not, and cannot be true. We
      know that seventy people could not increase to three million in two
      hundred and fifteen years.
    </p>
<p>
      About this time the Hebrews took a census, and found that there were
      twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three first-born males. It is
      reasonable to suppose that there were about as many first-born females.
      This would make forty-four thousand five hundred and forty-six first-born
      children. Now, there must have been about as many mothers as there were
      first-born children. If there were only about forty-five thousand mothers
      and three millions of people, the mothers must have had on an average
      about sixty-six children apiece.
    </p>
<p>
      At this time, the Hebrews were slaves, and had been for two hundred and
      fifteen years. A little while before, an order had been made by the
      Egyptians that all the male children of the Hebrews should be killed. One,
      contrary to this order, was saved in an ark made of bullrushes daubed with
      slime. This child was found by the daughter of Pharaoh, and was adopted,
      it seems, as her own, and, may be, was. He grew to be a man, sided with
      the Hebrews, killed an Egyptian that was smiting a slave, hid the body in
      the sand, and fled from Egypt to the land of Midian, became acquainted
      with a priest who had seven daughters, took the side of the daughters
      against the ill-mannered shepherds of that country, and married Zipporah,
      one of the girls, and became a shepherd for her father. Afterward, while
      tending his flock, the Lord appeared to him in a burning bush, and
      commanded him to go to the king of Egypt and demand from him the
      liberation of the Hebrews. In order to convince him that the something
      burning in the bush was actually God, the rod in his hand was changed into
      a serpent, which, upon being caught by the tail, became again a rod. Moses
      was also told to put his hand in his bosom, and when he took it out it was
      as leprous as snow. Quite a number of strange things were performed, and
      others promised. Moses then agreed to go back to Egypt provided his
      brother could go with him. Whereupon the Lord appeared to Aaron, and
      directed him to meet Moses in the wilderness. They met at the mount of
      God, went to Egypt, gathered together all the elders of the children of
      Israel, spake all the words which God had spoken unto Moses, and did all
      the signs in the sight of the people. The Israelites believed, bowed their
      heads and worshiped; and Moses and Aaron went in and told their message to
      Pharaoh the king.
    </p>
<p>
      XXII. THE PLAGUES.
    </p>
<p>
      Three millions of people were in slavery. They were treated with the
      utmost rigor, and so fearful were their masters that they might, in time,
      increase in numbers sufficient to avenge themselves, that they took from
      the arms of mothers all the male children and destroyed them. If the
      account given is true, the Egyptians were the most cruel, heartless and
      infamous people of which history gives any record. God finally made up his
      mind to free the Hebrews; and for the accomplishment of this purpose he
      sent, as his agents, Moses and Aaron, to the king of Egypt. In order that
      the king might know that these men had a divine mission, God gave Moses
      the power of changing a stick into a serpent, and water into blood. Moses
      and Aaron went before the king, stating that the Lord God of Israel
      ordered the king of Egypt to let the Hebrews go that they might hold a
      feast with God in the wilderness. Thereupon Pharaoh, the king, enquired
      who the Lord was, at the same time stating that he had never made his
      acquaintance, and knew nothing about him. To this they replied that the
      God of the Hebrews had met with them, and they asked to go a three days
      journey into the desert and sacrifice unto this God, fearing that if they
      did not he would fall upon them with pestilence or the sword. This
      interview seems to have hardened Pharaoh, for he ordered the tasks of the
      children of Israel to be increased; so that the only effect of the first
      appeal was to render still worse the condition of the Hebrews. Thereupon,
      Moses returned unto the Lord and said, "Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil
      entreated this people? Why is it that thou hast sent me? For since I came
      to Pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people; neither
      hast thou delivered thy people at all."
    </p>
<p>
      Apparently stung by this reproach, God answered:—
    </p>
<p>
      "Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharoah; for with a strong hand
      shall he let them go; and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of
      his land."
    </p>
<p>
      God then recounts the fact that he had appeared unto Abraham, Isaac and
      Jacob, that he had established a covenant with them to give them the land
      of Canaan, that he had heard the groanings of the children of Israel in
      Egyptian bondage; that their groanings had put him in mind of his
      covenant, and that he had made up his mind to redeem the children of
      Israel with a stretched-out arm and with great judgments. Moses then spoke
      to the children of Israel again, but they would listen to him no more. His
      first effort in their behalf had simply doubled their trouble and they
      seemed to have lost confidence in his power. Thereupon Jehovah promised
      Moses that he would make him a god unto Pharaoh, and that Aaron should be
      his prophet, but at the same time informed him that his message would be
      of no avail; that he would harden the heart of Pharaoh so that he would
      not listen; that he would so harden his heart that he might have an excuse
      for destroying the Egyptians. Accordingly, Moses and Aaron again went
      before Pharaoh. Moses said to Aaron;—"Cast down your rod before
      Pharaoh," which he did, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh not in the
      least surprised, called for his wise men and his sorcerers, and they threw
      down their rods and changed them into serpents. The serpent that had been
      changed from Aaron's rod was, at this time crawling upon the floor, and it
      proceeded to swallow the serpents that had been produced by the magicians
      of Egypt. What became of these serpents that were swallowed, whether they
      turned back into sticks again, is not stated. Can we believe that the
      stick was changed into a real living serpent, or did it assume simply the
      appearance of a serpent? If it bore only the appearance of a serpent it
      was a deception, and could not rise above the dignity of legerdemain. Is
      it necessary to believe that God is a kind of prestigiator—a
      sleight-of-hand performer, a magician or sorcerer? Can it be possible that
      an infinite being would endeavor to secure the liberation of a race by
      performing a miracle that could be equally performed by the sorcerers and
      magicians of a barbarian king?
    </p>
<p>
      Not one word was said by Moses or Aaron as to the wickedness of depriving
      a human being of his liberty. Not a word was said in favor of liberty. Not
      the slightest intimation that a human being was justly entitled to the
      product of his own labor. Not a word about the cruelty of masters who
      would destroy even the babes of slave mothers. It seems to me wonderful
      that this God did not tell the king of Egypt that no nation could enslave
      another, without also enslaving itself; that it was impossible to put a
      chain around the limbs of a slave, without putting manacles upon the brain
      of the master. Why did he not tell him that a nation founded upon slavery
      could not stand? Instead of declaring these things, instead of appealing
      to justice, to mercy and to liberty, he resorted to feats of jugglery.
      Suppose we wished to make a treaty with a barbarous nation, and the
      President should employ a sleight-of-hand performer as envoy
      extraordinary, and instruct him, that when he came into the presence of
      the savage monarch, he should cast down an umbrella or a walking stick,
      which would change into a lizard or a turtle; what would we think? Would
      we not regard such a performance as beneath the dignity even of a
      President? And what would be our feelings if the savage king sent for his
      sorcerers and had them perform the same feat? If such things would appear
      puerile and foolish in the President of a great republic, what shall be
      said when they were resorted to by the creator of all worlds? How small,
      how contemptible such a God appears! Pharaoh, it seems, took about this
      view of the matter, and he would not be persuaded that such tricks were
      performed by an infinite being.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, Moses and Aaron came before Pharaoh as he was going to the river's
      bank, and the same rod which had changed to a serpent, and, by this time
      changed back, was taken by Aaron, who, in the presence of Pharaoh, smote
      the water of the river, which was immediately turned to blood, as well as
      all the water in all the streams, ponds, and pools, as well as all water
      in vessels of wood and vessels of stone in the entire land of Egypt. As
      soon as all the waters in Egypt had been turned into blood, the magicians
      of that country did the same with their enchantments. We are not informed
      where they got the water to turn into blood, since all the water in Egypt
      had already been so changed. It seems from the account that the fish in
      the Nile died, and the river emitted a stench, and there was not a drop of
      water in the land of Egypt that had not been changed into blood. In
      consequence of this, the Egyptians digged "around about the river" for
      water to drink. Can we believe this story? Is it necessary to salvation to
      admit that all the rivers, pools, ponds and lakes of a country were
      changed into blood, in order that a king might be induced to allow the
      children of Israel the privilege of going a three days journey into the
      wilderness to make sacrifices to their God?
    </p>
<p>
      It seems from the account that Pharaoh was told that the God of the
      Hebrews would, if he refused to let the Israelites go, change all the
      waters of Egypt into blood, and that, upon his refusal, they were so
      changed. This had, however, no influence upon him, for the reason that his
      own magicians did the same. It does not appear that Moses and Aaron
      expressed the least surprise at the success of the Egyptian sorcerers. At
      that time it was believed that each nation had its own god. The only claim
      that Moses and Aaron made for their God was, that he was the greatest and
      most powerful of all the gods, and that with anything like an equal chance
      he could vanquish the deity of any other nation.
    </p>
<p>
      After the waters were changed to blood Moses and Aaron waited for seven
      days. At the end of that time God told Moses to again go to Pharaoh and
      demand the release of his people, and to inform him that, if he refused,
      God would strike all the borders of Egypt with frogs. That he would make
      frogs so plentiful that they would go into the houses of Pharaoh, into his
      bedchamber, upon his bed, into the houses of his servants, upon his
      people, into their ovens, and even into their kneading troughs. This
      threat had no effect whatever upon Pharaoh. And thereupon Aaron stretched
      out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered
      the land. The magicians of Egypt did the same, and with their enchantments
      brought more frogs upon the land of Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      These magicians do not seem to have been original in their ideas, but so
      far as imitation is concerned, were perfect masters of their art. The
      frogs seem to have made such an impression upon Pharaoh that he sent for
      Moses and asked him to entreat the Lord that he would take away the frogs.
      Moses agreed to remove them from the houses and the land, and allow them
      to remain only in the rivers. Accordingly the frogs died out of the
      houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields, and the people
      gathered them together in heaps. As soon as the frogs had left the houses
      and fields, the heart of Pharaoh became again hardened, and he refused to
      let the people go.
    </p>
<p>
      Aaron then, according to the command of God, stretched out his hand,
      holding the rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in
      man and in beast, and all the dust became lice throughout the land of
      Egypt. Pharaoh again sent for his magicians, and they sought to do the
      same with their enchantments, but they could not. Whereupon the sorcerers
      said unto Pharaoh: "This is the finger of God."
    </p>
<p>
      Notwithstanding this, however, Pharaoh refused to let the Hebrews go. God
      then caused a grievous swarm of flies to come into the house of Pharaoh
      and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt, to such an
      extent that the whole land was corrupted by reason of the flies. But into
      that part of the country occupied by the children of Israel there came no
      flies. Thereupon Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them: "Go,
      and sacrifice to your God in this land." They were not willing to
      sacrifice in Egypt, and asked permission to go on a journey of three days
      into the wilderness. To this Pharaoh acceded, and in consideration of this
      Moses agreed to use his influence with the Lord to induce him to send the
      flies out of the country. He accordingly told the Lord of the bargain he
      had made with Pharaoh, and the Lord agreed to the compromise, and removed
      the flies from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people, and
      there remained not a single fly in the land of Egypt. As soon as the flies
      were gone, Pharaoh again changed his mind, and concluded not to permit the
      children of Israel to depart. The Lord then directed Moses to go to
      Pharaoh and tell him that if he did not allow the children of Israel to
      depart, he would destroy his cattle, his horses, his camels and his sheep;
      that these animals would be afflicted with a grievous disease, but that
      the animals belonging to the Hebrews should not be so afflicted. Moses did
      as he was bid. On the next day all the cattle of Egypt died; that is to
      say, all the horses, all the asses, all the camels, all the oxen and all
      the sheep; but of the animals owned by the Israelites, not one perished.
      This disaster had no effect upon Pharaoh, and he still refused to let the
      children of Israel go. The Lord then told Moses and Aaron to take some
      ashes out of a furnace, and told Moses to sprinkle them toward the heavens
      in the sight of Pharaoh; saying that the ashes should become small dust in
      all the land of Egypt, and should be a boil breaking forth with blains
      upon man and upon beast throughout all the land.
    </p>
<p>
      How these boils breaking out with blains, upon cattle that were already
      dead, should affect Pharaoh, is a little hard to understand. It must not
      be forgotten that all the cattle and all beasts had died with the murrain
      before the boils had broken out.
    </p>
<p>
      This was a most decisive victory for Moses and Aaron. The boils were upon
      the magicians to that extent that they could not stand before Moses. But
      it had no effect upon Pharaoh, who seems to have been a man of great
      firmness. The Lord then instructed Moses to get up early in the morning
      and tell Pharaoh that he would stretch out his hand and smite his people
      with a pestilence, and would, on the morrow, cause it to rain a very
      grievous hail, such as had never been known in the land of Egypt. He also
      told Moses to give notice, so that they might get all the cattle that were
      in the fields under cover. It must be remembered that all these cattle had
      recently died of the murrain, and their dead bodies had been covered with
      boils and blains. This, however, had no effect, and Moses stretched forth
      his hand toward heaven, and the Lord sent thunder, and hail and lightning,
      and fire that ran along the ground, and the hail fell upon all the land of
      Egypt, and all that were in the fields, both man and beast, were smitten,
      and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the
      country except that portion inhabited by the children of Israel; there,
      there was no hail.
    </p>
<p>
      During this hail storm Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and admitted that
      he had sinned, that the Lord was righteous, and that the Egyptians were
      wicked, and requested them to ask the Lord that there be no more
      thunderings and hail, and that he would let the Hebrews go. Moses agreed
      that as soon as he got out of the city he would stretch forth his hands
      unto the Lord, and that the thunderings should cease and the hail should
      stop. But, when the rain and the hail and the thundering ceased, Pharaoh
      concluded that he would not let the children of Israel go.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, God sent Moses and Aaron, instructing them to tell Pharaoh that if
      he refused to let the people go, the face of the earth would be covered
      with locusts, so that man would not be able to see the ground, and that
      these locusts would eat the residue of that which escaped from the hail;
      that they would eat every tree out of the field; that they would fill the
      houses of Pharaoh and the houses of all his servants, and the houses of
      all the Egyptians. Moses delivered the message, and went out from Pharaoh.
      Some of Pharaoh's servants entreated their master to let the children of
      Israel go. Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and asked them, who wished to
      go into the wilderness to sacrifice. They replied that they wished to go
      with the young and old; with their sons and daughters, with flocks and
      herds. Pharaoh would not consent to this, but agreed that the men might
      go. Thereupon Pharaoh drove Moses and Aaron out of his sight. Then God
      told Moses to stretch forth his hand upon the land of Egypt for the
      locusts, that they might come up and eat every herb, even all that the
      hail had left. "And Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt,
      and the Lord brought an east wind all that day and all that night; and
      when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts; and they came up
      over all the land of Egypt and rested upon all the coasts covering the
      face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every
      herb and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and there
      remained not any green thing on the trees or in the herbs of the field
      throughout the land of Egypt." Pharaoh then called for Moses and Aaron in
      great haste, admitted that he had sinned against the Lord their God and
      against them, asked their forgiveness and requested them to intercede with
      God that he might take away the locusts. They went out from his presence
      and asked the Lord to drive the locusts away, "And the Lord made a strong
      west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red Sea so
      that there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt."
    </p>
<p>
      As soon as the locusts were gone, Pharaoh changed his mind, and, in the
      language of the sacred text, "the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he
      would not let the children of Israel go."
    </p>
<p>
      The Lord then told Moses to stretch out his hand toward heaven that there
      might be darkness over the land of Egypt, "even darkness which might be
      felt." "And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a
      thick darkness over the land of Egypt for three days during which time
      they saw not each other, neither arose any of the people from their places
      for three days; but the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
    </p>
<p>
      It strikes me that when the land of Egypt was covered with thick darkness—so
      thick that it could be felt, and when light was in the dwellings of the
      Israelites, there could have been no better time for the Hebrews to have
      left the country.
    </p>
<p>
      Pharaoh again called for Moses, and told him that his people could go and
      serve the Lord, provided they would leave their flocks and herds. Moses
      would not agree to this, for the reason that they needed the flocks and
      herds for sacrifices and burnt offerings, and he did not know how many of
      the animals God might require, and for that reason he could not leave a
      single hoof. Upon the question of the cattle, they divided, and Pharaoh
      again refused to let the people go. God then commanded Moses to tell the
      Hebrews to borrow, each of his neighbor, jewels of silver and gold. By a
      miraculous interposition the Hebrews found favor in the sight of the
      Egyptians so that they loaned the articles asked for. After this, Moses
      again went to Pharaoh and told him that all the first-born in the land of
      Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh upon the throne, unto the first-born
      of the maid-servant who was behind the mill, as well as the first-born of
      beasts, should die.
    </p>
<p>
      As all the beasts had been destroyed by disease and hail, it is
      troublesome to understand the meaning of the threat as to their
      first-born.
    </p>
<p>
      Preparations were accordingly made for carrying this frightful threat into
      execution. Blood was put on the door-posts of all houses inhabited by
      Hebrews, so that God, as he passed through that land, might not be
      mistaken and destroy the first-born of the Jews. "And it came to pass that
      at midnight the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, the
      first-born of Pharaoh who sat on the throne, and the first-born of the
      captive who was in the dungeon. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, and all
      his servants, and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt,
      for there was not a house where there was not one dead."
    </p>
<p>
      What had these children done? Why should the babes in the cradle be
      destroyed on account of the crime of Pharaoh? Why should the cattle be
      destroyed because man had enslaved his brother? In those days women and
      children and cattle were put upon an exact equality, and all considered as
      the property of the men; and when man in some way excited the wrath of
      God, he punished them by destroying all their cattle, their wives, and
      their little ones. Where can words be found bitter enough to describe a
      god who would kill wives and babes because husbands and fathers had failed
      to keep his law? Every good man, and every good woman, must hate and
      despise such a deity.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon the death of all the first-born Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and
      not only gave his consent that they might go with the Hebrews into the
      wilderness, but besought them to go at once.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible that an infinite God, creator of all worlds and sustainer
      of all life, said to Pharaoh, "If you do not let my people go, I will turn
      all the water of your country into blood," and that upon the refusal of
      Pharaoh to release the people, God did turn all the waters into blood? Do
      you believe this?
    </p>
<p>
      Do you believe that Pharaoh even after all the water was turned to blood,
      refused to let the Hebrews go, and that thereupon God told him he would
      cover his land with frogs? Do you believe this?
    </p>
<p>
      Do you believe that after the land was covered with frogs Pharaoh still
      refused to let the people go, and that God then said to him, "I will cover
      you and all your people with lice?" Do you believe God would make this
      threat?
    </p>
<p>
      Do you also believe that God told Pharaoh, "It you do not let these people
      go, I will fill all your houses and cover your country with flies?" Do you
      believe God makes such threats as this?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course God must have known that turning the waters into blood, covering
      the country with frogs, infesting all flesh with lice, and filling all
      houses with flies, would not accomplish his object, and that all these
      plagues would have no effect whatever upon the Egyptian king.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you believe that, failing to accomplish anything by the flies, God told
      Pharaoh that if he did not let the people go he would kill his cattle with
      murrain? Does such a threat sound God-like?
    </p>
<p>
      Do you believe that, failing to effect anything by killing the cattle,
      this same God then threatened to afflict all the people with boils,
      including the magicians who had been rivaling him in the matter of
      miracles; and failing to do anything by boils, that he resorted to hail?
      Does this sound reasonable? The hail experiment having accomplished
      nothing, do you believe that God murdered the first-born of animals and
      men? Is it possible to conceive of anything more utterly absurd, stupid,
      revolting, cruel and senseless, than the miracles said to have been
      wrought by the Almighty for the purpose of inducing Pharaoh to liberate
      the children of Israel?
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not altogether more reasonable to say that the Jewish people, being
      in slavery, accounted for the misfortunes and calamities, suffered by the
      Egyptians, by saying that they were the judgments of God?
    </p>
<p>
      When the Armada of Spain was wrecked and scattered by the storm, the
      English people believed that God had interposed in their behalf, and
      publicly gave thanks. When the battle of Lepanto was won, it was believed
      by the Catholic world that the victory was given in answer to prayer. So,
      our fore-fathers in their Revolutionary struggle saw, or thought they saw,
      the hand of God, and most firmly believed that they achieved their
      independence by the interposition of the Most High.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, it may be that while the Hebrews were enslaved by the Egyptians,
      there were plagues of locusts and flies. It may be that there were some
      diseases by which many of the cattle perished. It may be that a pestilence
      visited that country so that in nearly every house there was some one
      dead. If so, it was but natural for the enslaved and superstitious Jews to
      account for these calamities by saying that they were punishments sent by
      their God. Such ideas will be found in the history of every country.
    </p>
<p>
      For a long time the Jews held these opinions, and they were handed from
      father to son simply by tradition. By the time a written language had been
      produced, thousands of additions had been made, and numberless details
      invented; so that we have not only an account of the plagues suffered by
      the Egyptians, but the whole woven into a connected story, containing the
      threats made by Moses and Aaron, the miracles wrought by them, the
      promises of Pharaoh, and finally the release of the Hebrews, as a result
      of the marvelous things performed in their behalf by Jehovah.
    </p>
<p>
      In any event it is infinitely more probable that the author was
      misinformed, than that the God of this universe was guilty of these
      childish, heartless and infamous things. The solution of the whole matter
      is this:—Moses was mistaken.
    </p>
<p>
      XXIII. THE FLIGHT.
    </p>
<p>
      Three millions of people, with their flocks and herds, with borrowed
      jewelry and raiment, with unleavened dough in kneading troughs bound in
      their clothes upon their shoulders, in one night commenced their journey
      for the land of promise. We are not told how they were informed of the
      precise time to start. With all the modern appliances, it would require
      months of time to inform three millions of people of any fact.
    </p>
<p>
      In this vast assemblage there were six hundred thousand men of war, and
      with them were the old, the young, the diseased and helpless. Where were
      those people going? They were going to the desert of Sinai, compared with
      which Sahara is a garden. Imagine an ocean of lava torn by storm and vexed
      by tempest, suddenly gazed at by a Gorgon and changed instantly to stone!
      Such was the desert of Sinai.
    </p>
<p>
      All of the civilized nations of the world could not feed and support three
      millions of people on the desert of Sinai for forty years. It would cost
      more than one hundred thousand millions of dollars, and would bankrupt
      Christendom. They had with them their flocks and herds, and the sheep were
      so numerous that the Israelites sacrificed, at one time, more than one
      hundred and fifty thousand first-born lambs. How were these flocks
      supported? What did they eat? Where were meadows and pastures for them?
      There was no grass, no forests—nothing! There is no account of its
      having rained baled hay, nor is it even claimed that they were
      miraculously fed. To support these flocks, millions of acres of pasture
      would have been required. God did not take the Israelites through the land
      of the Philistines, for fear that when they saw the people of that country
      they would return to Egypt, but he took them by the way of the wilderness
      to the Red Sea, going before them by day in a pillar of cloud, and by
      night, in a pillar of fire.
    </p>
<p>
      When it was told Pharaoh that the people had fled, he made ready and took
      six hundred chosen chariots of Egypt, and pursued after the children of
      Israel, overtaking them by the sea. As all the animals had long before
      that time been destroyed, we are not informed where Pharaoh obtained the
      horses for his chariots. The moment the children of Israel saw the hosts
      of Pharaoh, although they had six hundred thousand men of war, they
      immediately cried unto the Lord for protection. It is wonderful to me that
      a land that had been ravaged by the plagues described in the Bible, still
      had the power to put in the field an army that would carry terror to the
      hearts of six hundred thousand men of war. Even with the help of God, it
      seems, they were not strong enough to meet the Egyptians in the open
      field, but resorted to strategy. Moses again stretched forth his wonderful
      rod over the waters of the Red Sea, and they were divided, and the Hebrews
      passed through on dry land, the waters standing up like a wall on either
      side. The Egyptians pursued them; "and in the morning watch the Lord
      looked into the hosts of the Egyptians, through the pillar of fire," and
      proceeded to take the wheels off their chariots. As soon as the wheels
      were off, God told Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea. Moses did
      so, and immediately "the waters returned and covered the chariots and
      horsemen and all the hosts of Pharaoh that came into the sea, and there
      remained not so much as one of them."
    </p>
<p>
      This account may be true, but still it hardly looks reasonable that God
      would take the wheels off the chariots. How did he do it? Did he pull out
      the linch-pins, or did he just take them off by main force?
    </p>
<p>
      What a picture this presents to the mind! God the creator of the universe,
      maker of every shining, glittering star, engaged in pulling off the wheels
      of wagons, that he might convince Pharaoh of his greatness and power!
    </p>
<p>
      Where were these people going? They were going to the promised land. How
      large a country was that? About twelve thousand square miles. About
      one-fifth the size of the State of Illinois. It was a frightful country,
      covered with rocks and desolation. How many people were in the promised
      land already? Moses tells us there were seven nations in that country
      mightier than the Jews. As there were at least three millions of Jews,
      there must have been at least twenty-one millions of people already in
      that country. These had to be driven out in order that room might be made
      for the chosen people of God.
    </p>
<p>
      It seems, however, that God was not willing to take the children of Israel
      into the promised land immediately. They were not fit to inhabit the land
      of Canaan; so he made up his mind to allow them to wander upon the desert
      until all except two, who had left Egypt, should perish. Of all the slaves
      released from Egyptian bondage, only two were allowed to reach the
      promised land!
    </p>
<p>
      As soon as the Hebrews crossed the Red Sea, they found themselves without
      food, and with water unfit to drink by reason of its bitterness, and they
      began to murmur against Moses, who cried unto the Lord, and "the Lord
      showed him a tree." Moses cast this tree into the waters, and they became
      sweet. "And it came to pass in the morning the dew lay around about the
      camp; and when the dew that lay was gone, behold, upon the face of the
      wilderness lay a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost upon the
      ground. And Moses said unto them, this is the bread which the Lord hath
      given you to eat." This manna was a very peculiar thing. It would melt in
      the sun, and yet they could cook it by seething and baking. One would as
      soon think of frying snow or of broiling icicles. But this manna had
      another remarkable quality. No matter how much or little any person
      gathered, he would have an exact omer; if he gathered more, it would
      shrink to that amount, and if he gathered less, it would swell exactly to
      that amount. What a magnificent substance manna would be with which to
      make a currency—shrinking and swelling according to the great laws
      of supply and demand!
    </p>
<p>
      "Upon this manna the children of Israel lived for forty years, until they
      came to a habitable land. With this meat were they fed until they reached
      the borders of the land of Canaan." We are told in the twenty-first
      chapter of Numbers, that the people at last became tired of' the manna,
      complained of God, and asked Moses why he brought them out of the land of
      Egypt to die in the wilderness. And they said:—"There is no bread,
      nor have we any water. Our soul loatheth this light food."
    </p>
<p>
      We are told by some commentators that the Jews lived on manna for forty
      years; by others that they lived upon it for only a short time. As a
      matter of fact the accounts differ, and this difference is the opportunity
      for commentators. It also allows us to exercise faith in believing that
      both accounts are true. If the accounts agreed, and were reasonable, they
      would be believed by the wicked and unregenerated. But as they are
      different and unreasonable, they are believed only by the good. Whenever a
      statement in the Bible is unreasonable, and you believe it, you are
      considered quite a good Christian. If the statement is grossly absurd and
      infinitely impossible, and you still believe it, you are a saint.
    </p>
<p>
      The children of Israel were in the desert, and they were out of water.
      They had nothing to eat but manna, and this they had had so long that the
      soul of every person abhorred it. Under these circumstances they
      complained to Moses. Now, as God is infinite, he could just as well have
      furnished them with an abundance of the purest and coolest of water, and
      could, without the slightest trouble to himself, have given them three
      excellent meals a day, with a generous variety of meats and vegetables, it
      is very hard to see why he did not do so. It is still harder to conceive
      why he fell into a rage when the people mildly suggested that they would
      like a change of diet. Day after day, week after week, month after month,
      year after year, nothing but manna. No doubt they did the best they could
      by cooking it in different ways, but in spite of themselves they began to
      loathe its sight and taste, and so they asked Moses to use his influence
      to secure a change in the bill of fare.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, I ask, whether it was unreasonable for the Jews to suggest that a
      little meat would be very gratefully received? It seems, however, that as
      soon as the request was made, this God of infinite mercy became infinitely
      enraged, and instead of granting it, went into partnership with serpents,
      for the purpose of punishing the hungry wretches to whom he had promised a
      land flowing with milk and honey.
    </p>
<p>
      Where did these serpents come from? How did God convey the information to
      the serpents, that he wished them to go to the desert of Sinai and bite
      some Jews? It may be urged that these serpents were created for the
      express purpose of punishing the children of Israel for having had the
      presumption, like Oliver Twist, to ask for more.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another account in the eleventh chapter of Numbers, of the people
      murmuring because of their food. They remembered the fish, the cucumbers,
      the melons, the leeks, the onions and the garlic of Egypt, and they asked
      for meat. The people went to the tent of Moses and asked him for flesh.
      Moses cried unto the Lord and asked him why he did not take care of the
      multitude. God thereupon agreed that they should have meat, not for a day
      or two, but for a month, until the meat should come out of their nostrils
      and become loathsome to them. He then caused a wind to bring quails from
      beyond the sea, and cast them into the camp, on every side of the camp
      around about for the space of a days journey. And the people gathered
      them, and while the flesh was yet between their teeth the wrath of God
      being provoked against them, struck them with an exceeding great plague.
      Serpents, also, were sent among them, and thousands perished for the crime
      of having been hungry.
    </p>
<p>
      The Rev. Alexander Cruden commenting upon this account says:—
    </p>
<p>
      "God caused a wind to rise that drove the quails within and about the camp
      of the Israelites; and it is in this that the miracle consists, that they
      were brought so seasonably to this place, and in so great numbers as to
      suffice above a million of persons above a month. Some authors affirm,
      that in those eastern and southern countries, quails are innumerable, so
      that in one part of Italy within the compass of five miles, there were
      taken about an hundred thousand of them every day for a month together;
      and that sometimes they fly so thick over the sea, that being weary they
      fall into ships, sometimes in such numbers, that they sink them with their
      weight."
    </p>
<p>
      No wonder Mr. Cruden believed the Mosaic account.
    </p>
<p>
      Must we believe that God made an arrangement with hornets for the purpose
      af securing their services in driving the Canaanites from the land of
      promise? Is this belief necessary unto salvation? Must we believe that God
      said to the Jews that he would send hornets before them to drive out the
      Canaanites, as related in the twenty-third chapter of Exodus, and the
      second chapter of Deuteronomy? How would the hornets know a Canaanite? In
      what way would God put it in the mind of a hornet to attack a Canaanite?
      Did God create hornets for that especial purpose, implanting an instinct
      to attack a Canaanite, but not a Hebrew? Can we conceive of the Almighty
      granting letters of marque and reprisal to hornets? Of course it is
      admitted that nothing in the world would be better calculated to make a
      man leave his native land than a few hornets. Is it possible for us to
      believe that an infinite being would resort to such expedients in order to
      drive the Canaanites from their country? He could just as easily have
      spoken the Canaanites out of existence as to have spoken the hornets in.
      In this way a vast amount of trouble, pain and suffering would have been
      saved. Is it possible that there is, in this country, an intelligent
      clergyman who will insist that these stories are true; that we must
      believe them in in order to be good people in this world, and glorified
      souls in the next?
    </p>
<p>
      We are also told that God instructed the Hebrews to kill the Canaanites
      slowly, giving as a reason that the beasts of the field might increase
      upon his chosen people. When we take into consideration the fact that the
      Holy Land contained only about eleven or twelve thousand square miles, and
      was at that time inhabited by at least twenty-one millions of people, it
      does not seem reasonable that the wild beasts could have been numerous
      enough to cause any great alarm. The same ratio of population would give
      to the State of Illinois at least one hundred and twenty millions of
      inhabitants. Can anybody believe that, under such circumstances, the
      danger from wild beasts could be very great? What would we think of a
      general, invading such a State, if he should order his soldiers to kill
      the people slowly, lest the wild beasts might increase upon them? Is it
      possible that a God capable of doing the miracles recounted in the Old
      Testament could not, in some way, have disposed of the wild beasts? After
      the Canaanites were driven out, could he not have employed the hornets to
      drive out the wild beasts? Think of a God that could drive twenty-one
      millions of people out of the promised land, could raise up innumerable
      stinging flies, and could cover the earth with fiery serpents, and yet
      seems to have been perfectly powerless against the wild beasts of the land
      of Canaan!
    </p>
<p>
      Speaking of these hornets, one of the good old commentators, whose views
      have long been considered of great value by the believers in the
      inspiration of the Bible, uses the following language:—"Hornets are
      a sort of strong flies, which the Lord used as instruments to plague the
      enemies of his people. They are of themselves very troublesome and
      mischievous, and those the Lord made use of were, it is thought, of an
      extraordinary bigness and perniciousness. It is said they live as the
      wasps, and that they have a king or captain, and pestilent stings as bees,
      and that, if twenty-seven of them sting man or beast, it is certain death
      to either. Nor is it strange that such creatures did drive out the
      Canaanites from their habitations; for many heathen writers give instances
      of some people driven from their seats by frogs, others by mice, others by
      bees and wasps. And it is said that a Christian city, being besieged by
      Sapores, king of Persia, was delivered by hornets; for the elephants and
      beasts being stung by them, waxed unruly, and so the whole army fled."
    </p>
<p>
      Only a few years ago, all such stories were believed by the Christian
      world; and it is a historical fact, that Voltaire was the third man of any
      note in Europe, who took the ground that the mythologies of Greece and
      Rome were without foundation. Until his time, most Christians believed as
      thoroughly in the miracles ascribed to the Greek and Roman gods as in
      those of Christ and Jehovah. The Christian world cultivated credulity, not
      only as one of the virtues, but as the greatest of them all. But, when
      Luther and his followers left the Church of Rome, they were compelled to
      deny the power of the Catholic Church, at that time, to suspend the laws
      of nature, but took the ground that such power ceased with the apostolic
      age. They insisted that all things now happened in accordance with the
      laws of nature, with the exception of a few special interferences in favor
      of the Protestant Church in answer to prayer. They taught their children a
      double philosophy: by one, they were to show the impossibility of Catholic
      miracles, because opposed to the laws of nature; by the other, the
      probability of the miracles of the apostolic age, because they were in
      conformity with the statements of the Scriptures. They had two
      foundations: one, the law of nature, and the other, the word of God. The
      Protestants have endeavored to carry on this double process of reasoning,
      and the result has been a gradual increase of confidence in the law of
      nature, and a gradual decrease of confidence in the word of God.

      We are told, in this inspired account, that the clothing of the Jewish
      people did not wax old, and that their shoes refused to wear out. Some
      commentators have insisted that angels attended to the wardrobes of the
      Hebrews, patched their garments, and mended their shoes. Certain it is,
      however, that the same clothes lasted them for forty years, during the
      entire journey from Egypt to the Holy Land. Little boys starting out with
      their first pantaloons, grew as they traveled, and their clothes grew with
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      Can it be necessary to believe a story like this? Will men make better
      husbands, fathers, neighbors, and citizens, simply by giving credence to
      these childish and impossible things? Certainly an infinite God could have
      transported the Jews to the Holy Land in a moment, and could, as easily,
      have removed the Canaanites to some other country. Surely there was no
      necessity for doing thousands and thousands of petty miracles, day after
      day for forty years, looking after the clothes of three millions of
      people, changing the nature of wool and linen and leather, so that they
      would not "wax old." Every step, every motion, would wear away some part
      of the clothing, some part of the shoes. Were these parts, so worn away,
      perpetually renewed, or was the nature of things so changed that they
      could not wear away? We know that whenever matter comes in contact with
      matter, certain atoms, by abrasion, are lost. Were these atoms gathered up
      every night by angels, and replaced on the soles of the shoes, on the
      elbows of coats, and on the knees of pantaloons, so that the next morning
      they would be precisely in the condition they were on the morning before?
      There must be a mistake somewhere.
    </p>
<p>
      Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man to
      be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment? We are told in the
      thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take myrrh,
      cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a holy ointment
      for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables, candlesticks and
      other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying, at the same time,
      that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put any of it on a
      stranger, should be put to death. In the same chapter, the Lord furnishes
      Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying, that whoever should make
      any which smelled like it, should be cut off from his people. This, to me,
      sounds so unreasonable that I cannot believe it. Why should an infinite
      God care whether mankind made ointments and perfumes like his or not? Why
      should the Creator of all things threaten to kill a priest who approached
      his altar without having washed his hands and feet? These commandments and
      these penalties would disgrace the vainest tyrant that ever sat, by
      chance, upon a throne. There must be some mistake. I cannot believe that
      an infinite Intelligence appeared to Moses upon Mount Sinai having with
      him a variety of patterns for making a tabernacle, tongs, snuffers and
      dishes. Neither can I believe that God told Moses how to cut and trim a
      coat for a priest. Why should a God care about such things? Why should he
      insist on having buttons sewed in certain rows, and fringes of a certain
      color? Suppose an intelligent civilized man was to overhear, on Mount
      Sinai, the following instructions from God to Moses:—
    </p>
<p>
      "You must consecrate my priests as follows:—You must kill a bullock
      for a sin offering, and have Aaron and his sons lay their hands upon the
      head of the bullock. Then you must take the blood and put it upon the
      horns of the altar round about with your finger, and pour some blood at
      the bottom of the altar to make a reconciliation; and of the fat that is
      upon the inwards, the caul above the liver and two kidneys, and their fat,
      and burn them upon the altar. You must get a ram for a burnt offering, and
      Aaron and his sons must lay their hands upon the head of the ram. Then you
      must kill it and sprinkle the blood upon the altar, and cut the ram into
      pieces, and burn the head, and the pieces, and the fat, and wash the
      inwards and the lungs in water and then burn the whole ram upon the altar
      for a sweet savor unto me. Then you must get another ram, and have Aaron
      and his sons lay their hands upon the head of that, then kill it and take
      of its blood, and put it on the top of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb
      of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot. And you must
      also put a little of the blood upon the top of the right ears of Aaron's
      sons, and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the great toes of
      their right feet. And then you must take of the fat that is on the
      inwards, and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys, and their fat,
      and the right shoulder, and out of a basket of unleavened bread you must
      take one unleavened cake and another of oil bread, and one wafer, and put
      them on the fat of the right shoulder. And you must take of the anointing
      oil, and of the blood, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and
      on his sons' garments, and sanctify them and all their clothes."—Do
      you believe that he would have even suspected that the creator of the
      universe was talking?
    </p>
<p>
      Can any one now tell why God commanded the Jews, when they were upon the
      desert of Sinai, to plant trees, telling them at the same time that they
      must not eat any of the fruit of such trees until after the fourth year?
      Trees could not have been planted in that desert, and if they had been,
      they could not have lived. Why did God tell Moses, while in the desert, to
      make curtains of fine linen? Where could he have obtained his flax? There
      was no land upon which it could have been produced. Why did he tell him to
      make things of gold, and silver, and precious stones, when they could not
      have been in possession of these things? There is but one answer, and that
      is, the Pentateuch was written hundreds of years after the Jews had
      settled in the Holy Land, and hundreds of years after Moses was dust and
      ashes.
    </p>
<p>
      When the Jews had a written language, and that must have been long after
      their flight from Egypt, they wrote out their history and their laws.
      Tradition had filled the infancy of the nation with miracles and special
      interpositions in their behalf by Jehovah. Patriotism would not allow
      these wonders to grow small, and priestcraft never denied a miracle. There
      were traditions to the effect that God had spoken face to face with Moses;
      that he had given him the tables of the law, and had, in a thousand ways,
      made known his will; and whenever the priests wished to make new laws, or
      amend old ones, they pretended to have found something more that God said
      to Moses at Sinai. In this way obedience was more easily secured. Only a
      very few of the people could read, and, as a consequence, additions,
      interpolations and erasures had no fear of detection. In this way we
      account for the fact that Moses is made to speak of things that did not
      exist in his day, and were unknown for hundreds of years after his death.
    </p>
<p>
      In the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, we are told that the people, when
      numbered, must give each one a half shekel after the shekel of the <i>sanctuary</i>.
      At that time no such money existed, and consequently the account could
      not, by any possibility, have been written until after there was a shekel
      of the sanctuary, and there was no such thing until long after the death
      of Moses. If we should read that Cæsar paid his troops in pounds,
      shillings and pence, we would certainly know that the account was not
      written by Cæsar, nor in his time, but we would know that it was
      written after the English had given these names to certain coins.
    </p>
<p>
      So, we find, that when the Jews were upon the desert it was commanded that
      every mother should bring, as a sin offering, a couple of doves to the
      priests, and the priests were compelled to eat these doves in the most
      holy place. At the time this law appears to have been given, there were
      three million people, and only three priests, Aaron, Eleazer and Ithamar.
      Among three million people there would be, at least, three hundred births
      a day. Certainly we are not expected to believe that these three priests
      devoured six hundred pigeons every twenty-four hours.
    </p>
<p>
      Why should a woman ask pardon of God for having been a mother? Why should
      that be considered a crime in Exodus, which is commanded as a duty in
      Genesis? Why should a mother be declared unclean? Why should giving birth
      to a daughter be regarded twice as criminal as giving birth to a son? Can
      we believe that such laws and ceremonies were made and instituted by a
      merciful and intelligent God? If there is anything in this poor world
      suggestive of, and standing for, all that is sweet, loving and pure, it is
      a mother holding in her thrilled and happy arms her prattling babe. Read
      the twelfth chapter of Leviticus, and you will see that when a woman
      became the mother of a boy she was so unclean that she was not allowed to
      touch a hallowed thing, nor to enter the sanctuary for forty days. If the
      babe was a girl, then the mother was unfit for eighty days, to enter the
      house of God, or to touch the sacred tongs and snuffers. These laws, born
      of barbarism, are unworthy of our day, and should be regarded simply as
      the mistakes of savages.
    </p>
<p>
      Just as low in the scale of intelligence are the directions given in the
      fifth chapter of Numbers, for the trial of a wife of whom the husband was
      jealous. This foolish chapter has been the foundation of all appeals to
      God for the ascertainment of facts, such as the corsned, trial by battle,
      by water, and by fire, the last of which is our judicial oath. It is very
      easy to believe that in those days a guilty woman would be afraid to drink
      the water of jealousy and take the oath, and that, through fear, she might
      be made to confess. Admitting that the deception tended not only to
      prevent crime, but to discover it when committed, still, we cannot admit
      that an honest god would, for any purpose, resort to dishonest means. In
      all countries fear is employed as a means of getting at the truth, and in
      this there is nothing dishonest, provided falsehood is not resorted to for
      the purpose of producing the fear. Protestants laugh at Catholics because
      of their belief in the efficacy of holy water, and yet they teach their
      children that a little holy water, in which had been thrown some dust from
      the floor of the sanctuary, would, work a miracle in a woman's flesh. For
      hundreds of years our fathers believed that a perjurer could not swallow a
      piece of sacramental bread. Such stories belong to the childhood of our
      race, and are now believed only by mental infants and intellectual babes.
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot believe that Moses had in his hands a couple of tables of stone,
      upon which God had written the Ten Commandments, and that when he saw the
      golden calf, and the dancing, that he dashed the tables to the earth and
      broke them in pieces. Neither do I believe that Moses took a golden calf,
      burnt it, ground it to powder, and made the people drink it with water, as
      related in the thirty-second chapter of Exodus.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another account of the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses,
      in the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of Exodus. In this account not
      one word is said about the people having made a golden calf, nor about the
      breaking of the tables of stone. In the thirty-fourth chapter of Exodus,
      there is an account of the renewal of the broken tables of the law, and
      the commandments are given, but they are not the same commandments
      mentioned in the twentieth chapter. There are two accounts of the same
      transaction. Both of these stories cannot be true, and yet both must be
      believed. Any one who will take the trouble to read the nineteenth and
      twentieth chapters, and the last verse of the thirty-first chapter, the
      thirty-second, thirty-third, and thirty-fourth chapters of Exodus, will be
      compelled to admit that both accounts cannot be true.
    </p>
<p>
      From the last account it appears that while Moses was upon Mount Sinai
      receiving the commandments from God, the people brought their jewelry to
      Aaron and he cast for them a golden calf. This happened before any
      commandment against idolatry had been given. A god ought, certainly, to
      publish his laws before inflicting penalties for their violation. To
      inflict punishment for breaking unknown and unpublished laws is, in the
      last degree, cruel and unjust. It may be replied that the Jews knew better
      than to worship idols, before the law was given. If this is so, why should
      the law have been given? In all civilized countries, laws are made and
      promulgated, not simply for the purpose of informing the people as to what
      is right and wrong, but to inform them of the penalties to be visited upon
      those who violate the laws. When the Ten Commandments were given, no
      penalties were attached. Not one word was written on the tables of stone
      as to the punishments that would be inflicted for breaking any or all of
      the inspired laws. The people should not have been punished for violating
      a commandment before it was given. And yet, in this case, Moses commanded
      the sons of Levi to take their swords and slay every man his brother, his
      companion, and his neighbor. The brutal order was obeyed, and three
      thousand men were butchered.. The Levites consecrated themselves unto the
      Lord by murdering their sons, and their brothers, for having violated a
      commandment before it had been given.
    </p>
<p>
      It has been contended for many years that the Ten Commandments are the
      foundation of all ideas of justice and of law. Eminent jurists have bowed
      to popular prejudice, and deformed their works by statements to the effect
      that the Mosaic laws are the fountains from which sprang all ideas of
      right and wrong. Nothing can be more stupidly false than such assertions.
      Thousands of years before Moses was born, the Egyptians had a code of
      laws. They had laws against blasphemy, murder, adultery, larceny, perjury,
      laws for the collection of debts, the enforcement of contracts, the
      ascertainment of damages, the redemption of property pawned, and upon
      nearly every subject of human interest. The Egyptian code was far better
      than the Mosaic.
    </p>
<p>
      Laws spring from the instinct of self-preservation. Industry objected to
      supporting idleness, and laws were made against theft. Laws were made
      against murder, because a very large majority of the people have always
      objected to being murdered. All fundamental laws were born simply of the
      instinct of self-defence. Long before the Jewish savages assembled at the
      foot of Sinai, laws had been made and enforced, not only in Egypt and
      India, but by every tribe that ever existed.
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible for human beings to exist together, without certain rules
      of conduct, certain ideas of the proper and improper, of the right and
      wrong, growing out of the relation. Certain rules must be made, and must
      be enforced. This implies law, trial and punishment. Whoever produces
      anything by weary labor, does not need a revelation from heaven to teach
      him that he has a right to the thing produced. Not one of the learned
      gentlemen who pretend that the Mosaic laws are filled with justice and
      intelligence, would live, for a moment, in any country where such laws
      were in force.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can be more wonderful than the medical ideas of Jehovah. He had
      the strangest notions about the cause and cure of disease. With him
      everything was miracle and wonder. In the fourteenth chapter of Leviticus,
      we find the law for cleansing a leper:—"Then shall the priest take
      for him that is to be cleansed, two birds, alive and clean, and cedar
      wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. And the priest shall command that one of
      the birds be killed in an <i>earthen</i> vessel, over <i>running</i>
      water. As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and
      the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them, and the living bird, in
      the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. And he shall
      sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy, seven times,
      and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into
      the open field."
    </p>
<p>
      We are told that God himself gave these directions to Moses. Does anybody
      believe this? Why should the bird be killed in an <i>earthen</i> vessel?
      Would the charm be broken if the vessel was of wood? Why over <i>running</i>
      water? What would be thought of a physician now, who would give a
      prescription like that?
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not strange that God, although he gave hundreds of directions for
      the purpose of discovering the presence of leprosy, and for cleansing the
      leper after he was healed, forgot to tell how that disease could be cured?
      Is it not wonderful that while God told his people what animals were fit
      for food, he failed to give a list of plants that man might eat? Why did
      he leave his children to find out the hurtful and the poisonous by
      experiment, knowing that experiment, in millions of cases, must be death?
    </p>
<p>
      When reading the history of the Jewish people, of their flight from
      slavery to death, of their exchange of tyrants, I must confess that my
      sympathies are all aroused in their behalf. They were cheated, deceived
      and abused. Their god was quick-tempered, unreasonable, cruel, revengeful
      and dishonest. He was always promising but never performed. He wasted time
      in ceremony and childish detail, and in the exaggeration of what he had
      done. It is impossible for me to conceive of a character more utterly
      detestable than that of the Hebrew god. He had solemnly promised the Jews
      that he would take them from Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey.
      He had led them to believe that in a little while their troubles would be
      over, and that they would soon in the land of Canaan, surrounded by their
      wives and little ones, forget, the stripes and tears of Egypt. After
      promising the poor wanderers again and again that he would lead them in
      safety to the promised land of joy and plenty, this God, forgetting every
      promise, said to the wretches in his power:—"Your carcasses shall
      fall in this wilderness and your children shall wander until your
      carcasses be wasted." This curse was the conclusion of the whole matter.
      Into this dust of death and night faded all the promises of God. Into this
      rottenness of wandering despair fell all the dreams of liberty and home.
      Millions of corpses were left to rot in the desert, and each one certified
      to the dishonesty of Jehovah. I cannot believe these things. They are so
      cruel and heartless, that my blood is chilled and my sense of justice
      shocked. A book that is equally abhorrent to my head and heart, cannot be
      accepted as a revelation from God.
    </p>
<p>
      When we think of the poor Jews, destroyed, murdered, bitten by serpents,
      visited by plagues, decimated by famine, butchered by each other,
      swallowed by the earth, frightened, cursed, starved, deceived, robbed and
      outraged, how thankful we should be that we are not the chosen people of
      God. No wonder that they longed for the slavery of Egypt, and remembered
      with sorrow the unhappy day when they exchanged masters. Compared with
      Jehovah, Pharaoh was a benefactor, and the tyranny of Egypt was freedom to
      those who suffered the liberty of God.
    </p>
<p>
      While reading the Pentateuch, I am filled with indignation, pity and
      horror. Nothing can be sadder than the history of the starved and
      frightened wretches who wandered over the desolate crags and sands of
      wilderness and desert, the prey of famine, sword, and plague. Ignorant and
      superstitious to the last degree, governed by falsehood, plundered by
      hypocrisy, they were the sport of priests, and the food of fear. God was
      their greatest enemy, and death their only friend.
    </p>
<p>
      It is impossible to conceive of a more thoroughly despicable, hateful, and
      arrogant being, than the Jewish god. He is without a redeeming feature. In
      the mythology of the world he has no parallel. He, only, is never touched
      by agony and tears. He delights only in blood and pain. Human affections
      are naught to him. He cares neither for love nor music, beauty nor joy. A
      false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite, and tyrant, sincere
      in hatred, jealous, vain, and revengeful, false in promise, honest in
      curse, suspicious, ignorant, and changeable, infamous and hideous:—such
      is the God of the Pentateuch.
    </p>
<p>
      XXIV. CONFESS AND AVOID
    </p>
<p>
      The scientific Christians now admit that the Bible is not inspired in its
      astronomy, geology, botany, zoology, nor in any science. In other words,
      they admit that on these subjects, the Bible cannot be depended upon. If
      all the statements in the Scriptures were true, there would be no
      necessity for admitting that some of them are not inspired. A Christian
      will not admit that a passage in the Bible is uninspired, until he is
      satisfied that it is untrue. Orthodoxy itself has at last been compelled
      to say, that while a passage may be true and uninspired, it cannot be
      inspired if false.
    </p>
<p>
      If the people of Europe had known as much of astronomy and geology when
      the Bible was introduced among them, as they do now, there never could
      have been one believer in the doctrine of inspiration. If the writers of
      the various parts of the Bible had known as much about the sciences as is
      now known by every intelligent man, the book never could have been
      written. It was produced by ignorance, and has been believed and defended
      by its author. It has lost power in the proportion that man has gained
      knowledge. A few years ago, this book was appealed to in the settlement of
      all scientific questions; but now, even the clergy confess that in such
      matters, it has ceased to speak with the voice of authority. For the
      establishment of facts, the word of man is now considered far better than
      the word of God. In the world of science, Jehovah was superseded by
      Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. All that God told Moses, admitting the
      entire account to be true, is dust and ashes compared to the discoveries
      of Descartes, Laplace, and Humboldt. In matters of fact, the Bible has
      ceased to be regarded as a standard. Science has succeeded in breaking the
      chains of theology. A few years ago, Science endeavored to show that it
      was not inconsistent with the Bible. The tables have been turned, and now,
      Religion is endeavoring to prove that the Bible is not inconsistent with
      Science. The standard has been changed.
    </p>
<p>
      For many ages, the Christians contended that the Bible, viewed simply as a
      literary performance, was beyond all other books, and that man without the
      assistance of God could not produce its equal. This claim was made when
      but few books existed, and the Bible, being the only book generally known,
      had no rival. But this claim, like the other, has been abandoned by many,
      and soon will be, by all. Com pared with Shakespeare's "book and volume of
      the brain," the "sacred" Bible shrinks and seems as feebly impotent and
      vain, as would a pipe of Fan, when some great organ, voiced with every
      tone, from the hoarse thunder of the sea to the winged warble of a mated
      bird, floods and fills cathedral aisles with all the wealth of sound.
    </p>
<p>
      It is now maintained—and this appears to be the last fortification
      behind which the doctrine of inspiration skulks and crouches—that
      the Bible, although false and mistaken in its astronomy, geology,
      geography, history and philosophy, is inspired in its morality. It is now
      claimed that had it not been for this book, the world would have been
      inhabited only by savages, and that had it not been for the Holy
      Scriptures, man never would have even dreamed of the unity of God. A
      belief in one God is claimed to be a dogma of almost infinite importance,
      that with out this belief civilization is impossible, and that this fact
      is the sun around which all the virtues revolve. For my part, I think it
      infinitely more important to believe in man. Theology is a superstition—Humanity
      a religion.
    </p>
<p>
      XXV. "INSPIRED" SLAVERY
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps the Bible was inspired upon the subject of human slavery. Is
      there, in the civilized world, to-day, a clergyman who believes in the
      divinity of slavery? Does the Bible teach man to enslave his brother? If
      it does, is it not blasphemous to say that it is inspired of God? If you
      find the institution of slavery upheld in a book said to have been written
      by God, what would you expect to find in a book inspired by the devil?
      Would you expect to find that book in favor of liberty? Modern Christians,
      ashamed of the God of the Old Testament, endeavor now to show that slavery
      was neither commanded nor opposed by Jehovah. Nothing can be plainer than
      the following passages from the twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus.
      "Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of
      them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they
      begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. And ye shall take
      them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a
      possession, they shall be your bondmen forever. Both thy bondmen, and thy
      bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round
      about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen, and bondmaids."
    </p>
<p>
      Can we believe in this, the Nineteenth Century, that these infamous
      passages were inspired by God? that God approved not only of human
      slavery, but instructed his chosen people to buy the women, children and
      babes of the heathen round about them? If it was right for the Hebrews to
      buy, it was also right for the heathen to sell. This God, by commanding
      the Hebrews to buy, approved of the selling of sons and daughters. The
      Canaanite who, tempted by gold, lured by avarice, sold from the arms of
      his wife the dimpled babe, simply made it possible for the Hebrews to obey
      the orders of their God. If God is the author of the Bible, the reading of
      these passages ought to cover his cheeks with shame. I ask the Christian
      world to-day, was it right for the heathen to sell their children? Was it
      right for God not only to uphold, but to command the infamous traffic in
      human flesh? Could the most revengeful fiend, the most malicious vagrant
      in the gloom of hell, sink to a lower moral depth than this?
    </p>
<p>
      According to this God, his chosen people were not only commanded to buy of
      the heathen round about them, but were also permitted to buy each other
      for a term of years. The law governing the purchase of Jews is laid down
      in the twenty-first chapter of Exodus. "If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six
      years shall he serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
      If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married,
      then his wife shall go out with him. If his master have given him a wife,
      and she have borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall
      be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. And if the servant shall
      plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out
      free: Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring
      him to the door, or unto the door-post: and his master shall bore his ear
      through with an awl: and he shall serve him forever."
    </p>
<p>
      Do you believe that God was the author of this infamous law? Do you
      believe that the loving father of us all, turned the dimpled arms of babes
      into manacles of iron? Do you believe that he baited the dungeon of
      servitude with wife and child? Is it possible to love a God who would make
      such laws? Is it possible not to hate and despise him?
    </p>
<p>
      The heathen are not spoken of as human beings. Their rights are never
      mentioned. They were the rightful food of the sword, and their bodies were
      made for stripes and chains.
    </p>
<p>
      In the same chapter of the same inspired book, we are told that, "if a man
      smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he dies under his hand, he
      shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he
      shall not be punished, for he is his money."
    </p>
<p>
      Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of others?
      Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a legal tender
      for labor performed? Must we regard the auction block as an altar? Were
      blood hounds apostles? Was the slave-pen a temple? Were the stealers and
      whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?
    </p>
<p>
      It is now contended that while the Old Testament is touched with the
      barbarism of its time, that the New Testament is morally perfect, and that
      on its pages can be found no blot or stain. As a matter of fact, the New
      Testament is more decidedly in favor of human slavery than the old.
    </p>
<p>
      For my part, I never will, I never can, worship a God who upholds the
      institution of slavery. Such a God I hate and defy. I neither want his
      heaven, nor fear his hell.
    </p>
<p>
      XXXVI. "INSPIRED" MARRIAGE
    </p>
<p>
      Is there an orthodox clergyman in the world, who will now declare that he
      believes the institution of polygamy to be right? Is there one who will
      publicly declare that, in his judgment, that institution ever was right?
      Was there ever a time in the history of the world when it was right to
      treat woman simply as property? Do not attempt to answer these questions
      by saying, that the Bible is an exceedingly good book, that we are
      indebted for our civilization to the sacred volume, and that without it,
      man would lapse into savagery, and mental night. This is no answer. Was
      there a time when the institution of polygamy was the highest expression
      of human virtue? Is there a Christian woman, civilized, intelligent, and
      free, who believes in the institution of polygamy? Are we better, purer,
      and more intelligent than God was four thousand years ago? Why should we
      imprison Mormons, and worship God? Polygamy is just as pure in Utah, as it
      could have been in the promised land. Love and Virtue are the same the
      whole world round, and Justice is the same in every star. All the
      languages of the world are not sufficient to express the filth of
      polygamy. It makes of man, a beast, of woman, a trembling slave. It
      destroys the fireside, makes virtue an outcast, takes from human speech
      its sweetest words, and leaves the heart a den, where crawl and hiss the
      slimy serpents of most loathsome lust. Civilization rests upon the family.
      The good family is the unit of good government. The virtues grow about the
      holy hearth of home—they cluster, bloom, and shed their perfume
      round the fireside where the one man loves the one woman. Lover—husband—wife—mother—father—child—home!—?
      without these sacred words, the world is but a lair, and men and women
      merely beasts.
    </p>
<p>
      Why should the innocent maiden and the loving mother worship the heartless
      Jewish God? Why should they, with pure and stainless lips, read the vile
      record of inspired lust?
    </p>
<p>
      The marriage of the one man to the one woman is the citadel and fortress
      of civilization. Without this, woman becomes the prey and slave of lust
      and power, and man goes back to savagery and crime. From the bottom of my
      heart I hate, abhor and execrate all theories of life, of which the pure
      and sacred home is not the corner-stone. Take from the world the family,
      the fireside, the children born of wedded love, and there is nothing left.
      The home where virtue dwells with love is like a lily with a heart of fire—the
      fairest flower in all the world.
    </p>
<p>
      XXVII. "INSPIRED" WAR
    </p>
<p>
      If the Bible be true, God commanded his chosen people to destroy men
      simply for the crime of defending their native land. They were not allowed
      to spare trembling and white-haired age, nor dimpled babes clasped in the
      mothers' arms. They were ordered to kill women, and to pierce, with the
      sword of war, the unborn child. "Our heavenly Father" commanded the
      Hebrews to kill the men and women, the fathers, sons and brothers, but to
      preserve the girls alive. Why were not the maidens also killed? Why were
      they spared? Read the thirty-first chapter of Numbers, and you will find
      that the maidens were given to the soldiers and the priests. Is there, in
      all the history of war, a more infamous thing than this? Is it possible
      that God permitted the violets of modesty, that grow and shed their
      perfume in the maiden's heart, to be trampled beneath the brutal feet of
      lust? If this was the order of God, what, under the same circumstances,
      would have been the command of a devil? When, in this age of the world, a
      woman, a wife, a mother, reads this record, she should, with scorn and
      loathing, throw the book away. A general, who now should make such an
      order, giving over to massacre and rapine a conquered people, would be
      held in execration by the whole civilized world. Yet, if the Bible be
      true, the supreme and infinite God was once a savage.
    </p>
<p>
      A little while ago, out upon the western plains, in a little path leading
      to a cabin, were found the bodies of two children and their mother. Her
      breast was filled with wounds received in the defence of her darlings.
      They had been murdered by the savages. Suppose when looking at their
      lifeless forms, some one had said, "This was done by the command of God!"
      In Canaan there were countless scenes like this. There was no pity in
      inspired war. God raised the black flag, and commanded his soldiers to
      kill even the smiling infant in its mother's arms. Who is the blasphemer;
      the man who denies the existence of God, or he who covers the robes of the
      Infinite with innocent blood?
    </p>
<p>
      We are told in the Pentateuch, that God, the father of us all, gave
      thousands of maidens, after having killed their fathers, their mothers,
      and their brothers, to satisfy the brutal lusts of savage men. If there be
      a God, I pray him to write in his book, opposite my name, that I denied
      this lie for him.
    </p>
<p>
      XXVIII. "INSPIRED" RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
    </p>
<p>
      According to the Bible, God selected the Jewish people through whom to
      make known the great fact, that he was the only true and living God. For
      this purpose, he appeared on several occasions to Moses—came down to
      Sinai's top clothed in cloud and fire, and wrought a thousand miracles for
      the preservation and education of the Jewish people. In their presence he
      opened the waters of the sea. For them he caused bread to rain from
      heaven. To quench their thirst, water leaped from the dry and barren rock.
      Their enemies were miraculously destroyed; and for forty years, at least,
      this God took upon himself the government of the Jews. But, after all
      this, many of the people had less confidence in him than in gods of wood
      and stone. In moments of trouble, in periods of disaster, in the darkness
      of doubt, in the hunger and thirst of famine, instead of asking this God
      for aid, they turned and sought the help of senseless things. This God,
      with all his power and wisdom, could not even convince a few wandering and
      wretched savages that he was more potent than the idols of Egypt. This God
      was not willing that the Jews should think and investigate for themselves.
      For heresy, the penalty was death. Where this God reigned, intellectual
      liberty was unknown. He appealed only to brute force; he collected taxes
      by threatening plagues; he demanded worship on pain of sword and fire;
      acting as spy, inquisitor, judge and executioner.
    </p>
<p>
      In the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, we have the ideas of God as to
      mental freedom. "If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or the
      wife of thy bosom, or thy friend which is as thine own soul, entice thee
      secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not
      known, thou nor thy fathers; namely of the gods of the people which are
      around about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end
      of the earth even unto the other end of the earth, Thou shalt not consent
      unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither shall thine eye pity him, neither
      shalt thou spare him, neither shalt thou conceal him. But thou shalt
      surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death,
      and afterward the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with
      stones that he die."
    </p>
<p>
      This is the religious liberty of God; the toleration of Jehovah. If I had
      lived in Palestine at that time, and my wife, the mother of my children,
      had said to me, "I am tired of Jehovah, he is always asking for blood; he
      is never weary of killing; he is always telling of his might and strength;
      always telling what he has done for the Jews, always asking for
      sacrifices; for doves and lambs—blood, nothing but blood.—Let
      us worship the sun. Jehovah is too revengeful, too malignant, too
      exacting. Let us worship the sun. The sun has clothed the world in beauty;
      it has covered the earth with flowers; by its divine light I first saw
      your face, and my beautiful babe."—If I had obeyed the command of
      God, I would have killed her. My hand would have been first upon her, and
      after that the hands of all the people, and she would have been stoned
      with stones until she died. For my part, I would never kill my wife, even
      if commanded so to do by the real God of this universe. Think of taking up
      some ragged rock and hurling it against the white bosom filled with love
      for you; and when you saw oozing from the bruised lips of the death wound,
      the red current of her sweet life—think of looking up to heaven and
      receiving the congratulations of the infinite fiend whose commandment you
      had obeyed!
    </p>
<p>
      Can we believe that any such command was ever given by a merciful and
      intelligent God? Suppose, however, that God did give this law to the Jews,
      and did tell them that whenever a man preached a heresy, or proposed to
      worship any other God that they should kill him; and suppose that
      afterward this same God took upon himself flesh, and came to this very
      chosen people and taught a different religion, and that thereupon the Jews
      crucified him; I ask you, did he not reap exactly what he had sown? What
      right would this God have to complain of a crucifixion suffered in
      accordance with his own command?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can be more infamous than intellectual tyranny. To put chains upon
      the body is as nothing compared with putting shackles on the brain. No god
      is entitled to the worship or the respect of man who does not give, even
      to the meanest of his children, every right that he claims for himself.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Pentateuch be true, religious persecution is a duty. The dungeons
      of the Inquisition were temples, and the clank of every chain upon the
      limbs of heresy was music in the ear of God. If the Pentateuch was
      inspired, every heretic should be destroyed; and every man who advocates a
      fact inconsistent with the sacred book, should be consumed by sword and
      flame.
    </p>
<p>
      In the Old Testament no one is told to reason with a heretic, and not one
      word is said about relying upon argument, upon education, nor upon
      intellectual development—nothing except simple brute force. Is there
      to-day a Christian who will say that four thousand years ago, it was the
      duty of a husband to kill his wife if she differed with him upon the
      subject of religion? Is there one who will now say that, under such
      circumstances, the wife ought to have been killed? Why should God be so
      jealous of the wooden idols of the heathen? Could he not compete with
      Baal? Was he envious of the success of the Egyptian magicians? Was it not
      possible for him to make such a convincing display of his power as to
      silence forever the voice of unbelief? Did this God have to resort to
      force to make converts? Was he so ignorant of the structure of the human
      mind as to believe all honest doubt a crime? If he wished to do away with
      the idolatry of the Canaanites, why did he not appear to them? Why did he
      not give them the tables of the law? Why did he only make known his will
      to a few wandering savages in the desert of Sinai? Will some theologian
      have the kindness to answer these questions? Will some minister, who now
      believes in religious liberty, and eloquently denounces the intolerance of
      Catholicism, explain these things; will he tell us why he worships an
      intolerant God? Is a god who will burn a soul forever in another world,
      better than a Christian who burns the body for a few hours in this? Is
      there no intellectual liberty in heaven? Do the angels all discuss
      questions on the same side? Are all the investigators in perdition? Will
      the penitent thief, winged and crowned, laugh at the honest folks in hell?
      Will the agony of the damned increase or decrease the happiness of God?
      Will there be, in the universe, an eternal <i>auto da fe?</i>
</p>
<p>
      XXIX. CONCLUSION
    </p>
<p>
      If the Pentateuch is not inspired in its astronomy, geology, geography,
      history or philosophy, if it is not inspired concerning slavery, polygamy,
      war, law, religious or political liberty, or the rights of men, women and
      children, what is it inspired in, or about? The unity of God?—that
      was believed long before Moses was born. Special providence?—that
      has been the doctrine of ignorance in all ages. The rights of property?—theft
      was always a crime. The sacrifice of animals?—that was a custom
      thousands of years before a Jew existed. The sacredness of life?—there
      have always been laws against murder. The wickedness of perjury?—truthfulness
      has always been a virtue. The beauty of chastity?—the Pentateuch
      does not teach it. Thou shalt worship no other God?—that has been
      the burden of all religions.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible that the Pentateuch could not have been written by
      uninspired men? that the assistance of God was necessary to produce these
      books? Is it possible that Galileo ascertained the mechanical principles
      of "Virtual Velocity," the laws of falling bodies and of all motion; that
      Copernicus ascertained the true position of the earth and accounted for
      all celestial phenomena; that Kepler discovered his three laws—discoveries
      of such importance that the 8th of May, 1618, may be called the birthday
      of modern science; that Newton gave to the world the Method of Fluxions,
      the Theory of Universal Gravitation, and the Decomposition of Light; that
      Euclid, Cavalieri, Descartes, and Leibnitz, almost completed the science
      of mathematics; that all the discoveries in optics, hydrostatics,
      pneumatics and chemistry, the experiments, discoveries, and inventions of
      Galvani, Volta, Franklin and Morse, of Trevethick, Watt and Fulton and of
      all the pioneers of progress—that all this was accomplished by
      uninspired men, while the writer of the Pentateuch was directed and
      inspired by an infinite God? Is it possible that the codes of China,
      India, Egypt, Greece and Rome were made by man, and that the laws recorded
      in the Pentateuch were alone given by God? Is it possible that �?schylus
      and Shakespeare, Burns, and Beranger, Goethe and Schiller, and all the
      poets of the world, and all their wondrous tragedies and songs, are but
      the work of men, while no intelligence except the infinite God could be
      the author of the Pentateuch? Is it possible that of all the books that
      crowd the libraries of the world, the books of science, fiction, history
      and song, that all save only one, have been produced by man? Is it
      possible that of all these, the Bible only is the work of God?
    </p>
<p>
      If the Pentateuch is inspired, the civilization of our day is a mistake
      and crime. There should be no political liberty. Heresy should be trodden
      out beneath the bigot's brutal feet. Husbands should divorce their wives
      at will, and make the mothers of their children houseless and weeping
      wanderers. Polygamy ought to be practiced; women should become slaves; we
      should buy the sons and daughters of the heathen and make them bondmen and
      bondwomen forever. We should sell our own flesh and blood, and have the
      right to kill our slaves. Men and women should be stoned to death for
      laboring on the seventh day. "Mediums," such as have familiar spirits,
      should be burned with fire. Every vestige of mental liberty should be
      destroyed, and reason's holy torch extinguished in the martyr's blood.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not far better and wiser to say that the Pentateuch while containing
      some good laws, some truths, some wise and useful things is, after all,
      deformed and blackened by the savagery of its time? Is it not far better
      and wiser to take the good and throw the bad away?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us admit what we know to be true; that Moses was mistaken about a
      thousand things; that the story of creation is not true; that the Garden
      of Eden is a myth; that the serpent and the tree of knowledge, and the
      fall of man are but fragments of old mythologies lost and dead; that woman
      was not made out of a rib; that serpents never had the power of speech;
      that the sons of God did not marry the daughters of men; that the story of
      the flood and ark is not exactly true; that the tower of Babel is a
      mistake; that the confusion of tongues is a childish thing; that the
      origin of the rainbow is a foolish fancy; that Methuselah did not live
      nine hundred and sixty-nine years; that Enoch did not leave this world,
      taking with him his flesh and bones; that the story of Sodom and Gomorrah
      is somewhat improbable; that burning brimstone never fell like rain; that
      Lot's wife was not changed into chloride of sodium; that Jacob did not, in
      fact, put his hip out of joint wrestling with God; that the history of
      Tamar might just as well have been left out; that a belief in Pharaoh's
      dreams is not essential to salvation; that it makes but little difference
      whether the rod of Aaron was changed to a serpent or not; that of all the
      wonders said to have been performed in Egypt, the greatest is, that
      anybody ever believed the absurd account; that God did not torment the
      innocent cattle on account of the sins of their owners; that he did not
      kill the first born of the poor maid behind the mill because of Pharaoh's
      crimes; that flies and frogs were not ministers of God's wrath; that lice
      and locusts were not the executors of his will; that seventy people did
      not, in two hundred and fifteen years, increase to three million; that
      three priests could not eat six hundred pigeons in a day; that gazing at a
      brass serpent could not extract poison from the blood; that God did not go
      in partnership with hornets; that he did not murder people simply because
      they asked for something to eat; that he did not declare the making of
      hair oil and ointment an offence to be punished with death; that he did
      not miraculously preserve cloth and leather; that he was not afraid of
      wild beasts; that he did not punish heresy with sword and fire; that he
      was not jealous, revengeful, and unjust; that he knew all about the sun,
      moon, and stars; that he did not threaten to kill people for eating the
      fat of an ox; that he never told Aaron to draw cuts to see which of two
      goats should be killed; that he never objected to clothes made of woolen
      mixed with linen; that if he objected to dwarfs, people with flat noses
      and too many fingers, he ought not to have created such folks; that he did
      not demand human sacrifices as set forth in the last chapter of Leviticus;
      that he did not object to the raising of horses; that he never commanded
      widows to spit in the faces of their brothers-in-law; that several
      contradictory accounts of the same transaction cannot all be true; that
      God did not talk to Abraham as one man talks to another; that angels were
      not in the habit of walking about the earth eating veal dressed with milk
      and butter, and making bargains about the destruction of cities; that God
      never turned himself into a flame of fire, and lived in a bush; that he
      never met Moses in a hotel and tried to kill him; that it was absurd to
      perform miracles to induce a king to act in a certain way and then harden
      his heart so that he would refuse; that God was not kept from killing the
      Jews by the fear that the Egyptians would laugh at him; that he did not
      secretly bury a man and then allow the corpse to write an account of the
      funeral; that he never believed the firmament to be solid; that he knew
      slavery was and always would be a frightful crime; that polygamy is but
      stench and filth; that the brave soldier will always spare an unarmed foe;
      that only cruel cowards slay the conquered and the helpless; that no
      language can describe the murderer of a smiling babe; that God did not
      want the blood of doves and lambs; that he did not love the smell of
      burning flesh; that he did not want his altars daubed with blood; that he
      did not pretend that the sins of a people could be transferred to a goat;
      that he did not believe in witches, wizards, spooks, and devils; that he
      did not test the virtue of woman with dirty water; that he did not suppose
      that rabbits chewed the cud; that he never thought there were any
      four-footed birds; that he did not boast for several hundred years that he
      had vanquished an Egyptian king; that a dry stick did not bud, blossom,
      and bear almonds in one night; that manna did not shrink and swell, so
      that each man could gather only just one omer; that it was never wrong to
      "countenance the poor man in his cause;" that God never told a people not
      to live in peace with their neighbors; that he did not spend forty days
      with Moses on Mount Sinai giving him patterns for making clothes, tongs,
      basins, and snuffers; that maternity is not a sin; that physical deformity
      is not a crime; that an atonement cannot be made for the soul by shedding
      innocent blood; that killing a dove over running water will not make its
      blood a medicine; that a god who demands love knows nothing of the human
      heart; that one who frightens savages with loud noises is unworthy the
      love of civilized men; that one who destroys children on account of the
      sins of their fathers is a monster; that an infinite god never threatened
      to give people the itch; that he never sent wild beasts to devour babes;
      that he never ordered the violation of maidens; that he never regarded
      patriotism as a crime; that he never ordered the destruction of unborn
      children; that he never opened the earth and swallowed wives and babes
      because husbands and fathers had displeased him; that he never demanded
      that men should kill their sons and brothers, for the purpose of
      sanctifying themselves; that we cannot please God by believing the
      improbable; that credulity is not a virtue; that investigation is not a
      crime; that every mind should be free; that all religious persecution is
      infamous in God, as well as man; that without liberty, virtue is
      impossible; that without freedom, even love cannot exist; that every man
      should be allowed to think and to express his thoughts; that woman is the
      equal of man; that children should be governed by love and reason; that
      the family relation is sacred; that war is a hideous crime; that all
      intolerance is born of ignorance and hate; that the freedom of today is
      the hope of to-morrow; that the enlightened present ought not to fall upon
      its knees and blindly worship the barbaric past; and that every free,
      brave and enlightened man should publicly declare that all the ignorant,
      infamous, heartless, hideous things recorded in the "inspired" Pentateuch
      are not the words of God, but simply "Some Mistakes of Moses."

<h2>
      SOME REASONS WHY
    </h2>
<h3>
      I.
    </h3>
<p>
      RELIGION makes enemies instead of friends. That one word, "religion,"
      covers all the horizon of memory with visions of war, of outrage, of
      persecution, of tyranny, and death. That one word brings to the mind every
      instrument with which man has tortured man. In that one word are all the
      fagots and flames and dungeons of the past, and in that word is the
      infinite and eternal hell of the future.
    </p>
<p>
      In the name of universal benevolence Christians have hated their
      fellow-men. Although they have been preaching universal love, the
      Christian nations are the warlike nations of the world. The most
      destructive weapons of war have been invented by Christians. The musket,
      the revolver, the rifled canon, the bombshell, the torpedo, the explosive
      bullet, have been invented by Christian brains.
    </p>
<p>
      Above all other arts, the Christian world has placed the art of war.
    </p>
<p>
      A Christian nation has never had the slightest respect for the rights of
      barbarians; neither has any Christian sect any respect for the rights of
      other sects. Anciently, the sects discussed with fire and sword, and even
      now, something happens almost every day to show that the old spirit that
      was in the Inquisition still slumbers in the Christian breast.
    </p>
<p>
      Whoever imagines himself a favorite with God, holds other people in
      contempt.
    </p>
<p>
      Whenever a man believes that he has the exact truth from God, there is in
      that man no spirit of compromise. He has not the modesty born of the
      imperfections of human nature; he has the arrogance of theological
      certainty and the tyranny born of ignorant assurance. Believing himself to
      be the slave of God, he imitates his master, and of all tyrants, the worst
      is a slave in power.
    </p>
<p>
      When a man really believes that it is necessary to do a certain thing to
      be happy forever, or that a certain belief is necessary to ensure eternal
      joy, there is in that man no spirit of concession. He divides the whole
      world into saints and sinners, into believers and unbelievers, into God's
      sheep and Devil's goats, into people who will be glorified and people who
      will be damned.
    </p>
<p>
      A Christian nation can make no compromise with one not Christian; it will
      either compel that nation to accept its doctrine, or it will wage war. If
      Christ, in fact, said "I came not to bring peace but a sword," it is the
      only prophecy in the New Testament that has been literally fulfilled.
    </p>
<p>
      II. DUTIES TO GOD.
    </p>
<p>
      RELIGION is supposed to consist in a discharge of the duties we owe to
      God. In other words, we are taught that God is exceedingly anxious that we
      should believe a certain thing. For my part, I do not believe that there
      is any infinite being to whom we owe anything. The reason I say this is,
      we can not owe any duty to any being who requires nothing—to any
      being that we cannot possibly help, to any being whose happiness we cannot
      increase. If God is infinite, we cannot make him happier than he is. If
      God is infinite, we can neither give, nor can he receive, anything.
      Anything that we do or fail to do, cannot, in the slightest degree, affect
      an infinite God; consequently, no relations can exist between the finite
      and the Infinite, if by relations is meant mutual duties and obligations.
    </p>
<p>
      Some tell us that it is the desire of God that we should worship him. What
      for? Why does he desire worship? Others tell us that we should sacrifice
      something to him. What for? Is he in want? Can we assist him? Is he
      unhappy? Is he in trouble? Does he need human sympathy? We cannot assist
      the Infinite, but we can assist our fellow-men. We can feed the hungry and
      clothe the naked, and enlighten the ignorant, and we can help, in some
      degree at least, toward covering this world with the mantle of joy.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not believe there is any being in this universe who gives rain for
      praise, who gives sunshine for prayer, or who blesses a man simply because
      he kneels.
    </p>
<p>
      The Infinite cannot receive praise or worship.
    </p>
<p>
      The Infinite can neither hear nor answer prayer.
    </p>
<p>
      An Infinite personality is an infinite impossibility.
    </p>
<p>
      III. INSPIRATION.
    </p>
<p>
      WE are told that we have in our possession the inspired will of God. What
      is meant by the word "inspired" is not exactly known; but whatever else it
      may mean, certainly it means that the "inspired" must be the true. If it
      is true, there is, in fact, no need of its being inspired—the truth
      will take care of itself.
    </p>
<p>
      The church is forced to say that the Bible differs from all other books;
      it is forced to say that it contains the actual will of God. Let us then
      see what inspiration really is. A man looks at the sea, and the sea says
      something to him. It makes an impression upon his mind. It awakens memory,
      and this impression depends upon the man's experience—upon his
      intellectual capacity. Another looks upon the same sea. He has a different
      brain; he has had a different experience. The sea may speak to him of joy,
      to the other of grief and tears. The sea cannot tell the same thing to any
      two human beings, because no two human beings have had the same
      experience.
    </p>
<p>
      A year ago, while the cars were going from Boston to Gloucester, we passed
      through Manchester. As the cars stopped, a lady sitting opposite, speaking
      to her husband, looking out of the window and catching, for the first
      time, a view of the sea, cried out, "Is it not beautiful!" and the husband
      replied, "I'll bet you could dig clams right here!"
    </p>
<p>
      Another, standing upon the shore, listening to what the great Greek
      tragedian called "the multitudinous laughter of the sea," may say: Every
      drop has visited all the shores of the earth; every one has been frozen in
      the vast and icy North; every one has fallen in snow, has been whirled by
      storms around mountain peaks; every one has been kissed to vapor by the
      sun; every one has worn the seven-hued garment of light; every one has
      fallen in pleasant rain, gurgled from springs and laughed in brooks while
      lovers wooed upon the banks, and every one has rushed with mighty rivers
      back to the sea's embrace. Everything in nature tells a different story to
      all eyes that see and to all ears that hear.
    </p>
<p>
      Once in my life, and once only, I heard Horace Greeley deliver a lecture.
      I think its title was, "Across the Continent." At last he reached the
      mammoth trees of California, and I thought "Here is an opportunity for the
      old man to indulge his fancy. Here are trees that have outlived a thousand
      human governments. There are limbs above his head older than the pyramids.
      While man was emerging from barbarism to something like civilization,
      these trees were growing. Older than history, every one appeared to be a
      memory, a witness, and a prophecy. The same wind that filled the sails of
      the Argonauts had swayed these trees." But these trees said nothing of
      this kind to Mr. Greeley. Upon these subjects not a word was told to him.
      Instead, he took his pencil, and after figuring awhile, remarked: "One of
      these trees, sawed into inch-boards, would make more than three hundred
      thousand feet of lumber."
    </p>
<p>
      I was once riding on the cars in Illinois. There had been a violent
      thunder-storm. The rain had ceased, the sun was going down. The great
      clouds had floated toward the west, and there they assumed most wonderful
      architectural shapes. There were temples and palaces domed and turreted,
      and they were touched with silver, with amethyst and gold. They looked
      like the homes of the Titans, or the palaces of the gods. A man was
      sitting near me. I touched him and said, "Did you ever see anything so
      beautiful!" He looked out. He saw nothing of the cloud, nothing of the
      sun, nothing of the color; he saw only the country and replied, "Yes, it
      is beautiful; I always did like rolling land." On another occasion I was
      riding in a stage. There had been a snow, and after the snow a sleet, and
      all the trees were bent, and all the boughs were arched. Every fence,
      every log cabin had been transfigured, touched with a glory almost beyond
      this world. The great fields were a pure and perfect white; the forests,
      drooping beneath their load of gems, made wonderful caves, from which one
      almost expected to see troops of fairies come. The whole world looked like
      a bride, jewelled from head to foot. A German on the back seat, hearing
      our talk, and our exclamations of wonder leaned forward, looked out of the
      stage window and said: "Yes, it looks like a clean table cloth!"
    </p>
<p>
      So, when we look upon a flower, a painting, a statue, a star, or a violet,
      the more we know, the more we have experienced, the more we have thought,
      the more we remember, the more the statue, the star, the painting, the
      violet has to tell. Nature says to me all that I am capable of
      understanding—gives all that I can receive.
    </p>
<p>
      As with star, or flower, or sea, so with a book. A man reads Shakespeare.
      What does he get from him? All that he has the mind to understand. He gets
      his little cup full. Let another read him who knows nothing of the drama,
      nothing of the impersonations of passion, and what does he get? Almost
      nothing. Shakespeare has a different story for each reader. He is a world
      in which each recognizes his acquaintances—he may know a few, he may
      know all.
    </p>
<p>
      The impression that nature makes upon the mind, the stories told by sea
      and star and flower, must be the natural food of thought. Leaving out for
      the moment the impression gained from ancestors, the hereditary fears and
      drifts and trends—the natural food of thought must be the impression
      made upon the brain by coming in contact through the medium of the five
      senses with what we call the outward world. The brain is natural. Its food
      is natural. The result, thought, must be natural. The supernatural can be
      constructed with no material except the natural. Of the supernatural we
      can have no conception. Thought may be deformed, and the thought of one
      may be strange to, and denominated as unnatural by, another; but it cannot
      be supernatural. It may be weak, it may be insane, but it is not
      supernatural. Above the natural man cannot rise, even with the aid of
      fancy's wings. There can can be deformed ideas, as there are deformed
      persons. There can be religions monstrous and misshapen, but they must be
      naturally produced. Some people have ideas about what they are pleased to
      call the supernatural; but what they call the supernatural is simply the
      deformed. The world is to each man according to each man. It takes the
      world as it really is and that man to make that man's world, and that
      man's world cannot exist without that man.
    </p>
<p>
      You may ask, and what of all this? I reply, as with everything in nature,
      so with the Bible. It has a different story for each reader. Is then the
      Bible a different book to every human being who reads it? It is. Can God
      then, through the Bible, make the same revelation to two persons? He
      cannot. Why? Because the man who reads it is the man who inspires.
      Inspiration is in the man, as well as in the book. God should have
      inspired readers as well as writers.
    </p>
<p>
      You may reply: "God knew that his book would be understood differently by
      each one, and that he really intended that it should be understood as it
      is understood by each." If this is so, then my understanding of the Bible
      is the real revelation to me. If this is so, I have no right to take the
      understanding of another. I must take the revelation made to me through my
      understanding, and by that revelation I must stand. Suppose then, that I
      do read this Bible honestly, fairly, and when I get through I am compelled
      to say, "The book is not true." If this is the honest result, then you are
      compelled to say, either that God has made no revelation to me, or that
      the revelation that it is not true, is the revelation made to me, and by
      which I am bound. If the book and my brain are both the work of the same
      Infinite God, whose fault is it that the book and the brain do not agree?
      Either God should have written a book to fit my brain, or should have made
      my brain to fit his book.
    </p>
<p>
      The inspiration of the Bible depends upon the ignorance of him who reads.
      There was a time when its geology, its astronomy, its natural history,
      were inspired. That time has passed. There was a time when its morality
      satisfied the men who ruled mankind. That time has passed. There was a
      time when the tyrant regarded its laws as good; when the master believed
      in its liberty; when strength gloried in its passages; but these laws
      never satisfied the oppressed, they were never quoted by the slave.
    </p>
<p>
      We have a sacred book, an inspired Bible, and I am told that this book was
      written by the same being who made every star, and who peopled infinite
      space with infinite worlds. I am also told that God created man, and that
      man is totally depraved. It has always seemed to me that an infinite being
      has no right to make imperfect things. I may be mistaken; but this is the
      only planet I have ever been on; I live in what might be called one of the
      rural districts of this universe, consequently I may be mistaken; I simply
      give the best and largest thought I have.
    </p>
<p>
      IV. GOD'S EXPERIMENT WITH THE JEWS
    </p>
<p>
      THE Bible tells us that men became so bad that God destroyed them all with
      the exception of eight persons; that afterwards he chose Abraham and some
      of his kindred, a wandering tribe, for the purpose of seeing whether or no
      they could be civilized. He had no time to waste with all the world. The
      Egyptians at that time, a vast and splendid nation, having a system of
      laws and free schools, believing in the marriage of the one man to the one
      woman; believing, too, in the rights of woman—a nation that had
      courts of justice and understood the philosophy of damages—these
      people had received no revelation from God,—they were left to grope
      in Nature's night. He had no time to civilize India, wherein had grown a
      civilization that fills the world with wonder still—a people with a
      language as perfect as ours, a people who had produced philosophers,
      scientists, poets. He had no time to waste on them; but he took a few, the
      tribe of Abraham. He established a perfect despotism—with no
      schools, with no philosophy, with no art, with no music—nothing but
      the sacrifices of dumb beasts—nothing but the abject worship of a
      slave. Not a word upon geology, upon astronomy; nothing, even, upon the
      science of medicine. Thus God spent hours and hours with Moses upon the
      top of Sinai, giving directions for ascertaining the presence of leprosy
      and for preventing its spread, but it never occurred to Jehovah to tell
      Moses how it could be cured. He told them a few things about what they
      might eat—prohibiting among other things four-footed birds, and one
      thing upon the subject of cooking. From the thunders and lightnings of
      Sinai he proclaimed this vast and wonderful fact: "Thou shalt not seethe a
      kid in its mother's milk." He took these people, according to our sacred
      Scriptures, under his immediate care, and for the purpose of controlling
      them he wrought wonderful miracles in their sight.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it not a little curious that no priest of one religion has ever been
      able to astonish a priest of another religion by telling a miracle? Our
      missionaries tell the Hindoos the miracles of the Bible, and the Hindoo
      priests, without the movement of a muscle, hear them and then recite
      theirs, and theirs do not astonish our missionaries in the least! Is it
      not a little curious that the priests of one religion never believe the
      priests of another? Is it not a little strange that the believers in
      sacred books regard all except their own as having been made by hypocrites
      and fools?
    </p>
<p>
      I heard the other day a story. A gentleman was telling some wonderful
      things and the listeners, with one exception, were saying, as he proceeded
      with his tale, "Is it possible?" "Did you ever hear anything so
      wonderful?" and when he had concluded, there was a kind of chorus of "Is
      it possible?" and "Can it be?" One man, however, sat perfectly quiet,
      utterly unmoved. Another listener said to him "Did you hear that?" and he
      replied "Yes." "Well," said the other, "You did not manifest much
      astonishment." "Oh, no," was the answer, "I am a liar myself."
    </p>
<p>
      I am told by the sacred Scriptures that, as a matter of fact, God, even
      with the help of miracles, failed to civilize the Jews, and this shows of
      how little real benefit, after all, it is, to have a ruler much above the
      people, or to simply excite the wonder of mankind. Infinite wisdom, if the
      account be true, could not civilize a single tribe. Laws made by Jehovah
      himself were not obeyed, and every effort of Jehovah failed. It is claimed
      that God made known his law and inspired men to write and teach his will,
      and yet, it was found utterly impossible to reform mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      V. CIVILIZED COUNTRIES
    </p>
<p>
      IN all civilized countries, it is now passionately asserted that slavery
      is a crime; that a war of conquest is murder; that polygamy enslaves
      woman, degrades man and destroys home; that nothing is more infamous than
      the slaughter of decrepit men, of helpless mothers, and of prattling
      babes; that captured maidens should not be given to their captors; that
      wives should not be stoned to death for differing with their husbands on
      the subject of religion. We know that there was a time, in the history of
      most nations, when all these crimes were regarded as divine institutions.
      Nations entertaining this view now are regarded as savage, and, with the
      exception of the South Sea Islanders, Feejees, a few tribes in Central
      Africa, and some citizens of Delaware, no human beings are found degraded
      enough to agree upon these subjects with Jehovah.
    </p>
<p>
      The only evidence we can have that a nation has ceased to be savage, is
      that it has abandoned these doctrines of savagery.
    </p>
<p>
      To every one except a theologian, it is easy to account for these mistakes
      and crimes by saying that civilization is a painful growth; that the moral
      perceptions are cultivated through ages of tyranny, of crime, and of
      heroism; that it requires centuries for man to put out the eyes of self
      and hold in lofty and in equal poise the golden scales of Justice.
      Conscience is born of suffering. Mercy is the child of the imagination.
      Man advances as he becomes acquainted with his surroundings, with the
      mutual obligations of life, and learns to take advantage of the forces of
      nature.
    </p>
<p>
      The believer in the inspiration of the Bible is compelled to say, that
      there was a time when slavery was right, when women could sell their
      babes, when polygamy was the highest form of virtue, when wars of
      extermination were waged with the sword of mercy, when religious
      toleration was a crime, and when death was the just penalty for having
      expressed an honest thought. He is compelled to insist that Jehovah is as
      bad now as he was then; that he is as good now as he was then. Once, all
      the crimes that I have mentioned were commanded by God; now they are
      prohibited. Once, God was in favor of them all; now the Devil is their
      defender. In other words, the Devil entertains the same opinion to-day
      that God held four thousand years ago. The Devil is as good now as Jehovah
      was then, and God was as bad then as the Devil is now. Other nations
      besides the Jews had similar laws and ideas—believed in and
      practiced the same crimes, and yet, it is not claimed that they received a
      revelation. They had no knowledge of the true God, and yet they practiced
      the same crimes, of their own motion, that the Jews did by command of
      Jehovah. From this it would seem that man can do wrong without a special
      revelation.
    </p>
<p>
      The passages upholding slavery, polygamy, war and religious persecution
      are certainly not evidences of the inspiration of that book. Suppose
      nothing had been in the Old Testament upholding these crimes, would the
      modern Christian suspect that it was not inspired on that account? Suppose
      nothing had been in the Old Testament except laws in favor of these
      crimes, would it still be insisted that it was inspired? If the Devil had
      inspired a book, will some Christian tell us in what respect, on the
      subjects of slavery, polygamy, war and liberty, it would have differed
      from some parts of the Old Testament? Suppose we knew that after inspired
      men had finished the Bible the Devil had gotten possession of it and had
      written a few passages, what part would Christians now pick out as being
      probably his work? Which of the following passages would be selected as
      having been written by the Devil: "Love thy neighbor as thyself," or "Kill
      all the males among the little ones, and kill every woman, but all the
      women children keep alive for yourselves"?
    </p>
<p>
      Is there a believer in the Bible who does not now wish that God, amid the
      thunders and lightnings of Sinai, had said to Moses that man should not
      own his fellow-man; that women should not sell their babes; that all men
      should be allowed to think and investigate for themselves, and that the
      sword never should be unsheathed to shed innocent blood? Is there a
      believer who would not be delighted to find that every one of the infamous
      passages are interpolations, and that the skirts of God were never
      reddened by the blood of maiden, wife, or babe? Is there an honest man who
      does not regret that God commanded a husband to stone his wife for
      suggesting the worship of some other God? Surely we do not need an
      inspired book to teach us that slavery is right, that polygamy is virtue,
      and that intellectual liberty is a crime.
    </p>
<p>
      VI. A COMPARISON OF BOOKS
    </p>
<p>
      LET us compare the gems of Jehovah with Pagan paste. It may be that the
      best way to illustrate what I have said, is to compare the supposed
      teachings of Jehovah with those of persons who never wrote an inspired
      line. In all ages of which any record has been preserved, men have given
      their ideas of justice, charity, liberty, love and law. If the Bible is
      the work of God, it should contain the sublimest truths, it should excel
      the works of man, it should contain the loftiest definitions of justice,
      the best conceptions of human liberty, the clearest outlines of duty, the
      tenderest and noblest thoughts. Upon every page should be found the
      luminous evidence of its divine origin. It should contain grander and more
      wonderful things than man has written.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be said that it is unfair to call attention to bad things in the
      Bible. To this it may be replied that a divine being ought not to put bad
      things in his book. If the Bible now upholds what we call crimes, it will
      not do to say that it is not verbally inspired. If the words are not
      inspired, what is? It may be said, that the thoughts are inspired. This
      would include only thoughts expressed without words. If ideas are
      inspired, they must be expressed by inspired words—that is to say,
      by an inspired arrangement of words. If a sculptor were inspired of God to
      make a statue, we would not say that the marble was inspired, but the
      statue—that is to say, the relation of part to part, the married
      harmony of form and function. The language, the words, take the place of
      the marble, and it is the arrangement of the words that Christians claim
      to be inspired. If there is an uninspired word, or a word in the wrong
      place, until that word is known a doubt is cast on every word the book
      contains.
    </p>
<p>
      If it was worth God's while to make a revelation at all, it was certainly
      worth his while to see that it was correctly made—that it was
      absolutely preserved.
    </p>
<p>
      Why should God allow an inspired book to be interpolated? If it was worth
      while to inspire men to write it, it was worth while to inspire men to
      preserve it; and why should he allow another person to interpolate in it
      that which was not inspired? He certainly would not have allowed the man
      he inspired to write contrary to the inspiration. He should have preserved
      his revelation. Neither will it do to say that God adapted his revelation
      to the prejudices of man. It was necessary for him to adapt his revelation
      to the capacity of man, but certainly God would not confirm a barbarian in
      his prejudices. He would not fortify a heathen in his crimes....
    </p>
<p>
      If a revelation is of any importance, it is to eradicate prejudice. They
      tell us now that the Jews were so ignorant, so bad, that God was compelled
      to justify their crimes, in order to have any influence with them. They
      say that if he had declared slavery and polygamy to be crimes, the Jews
      would have refused to receive the Ten Commandments. They tell us that God
      did the best he could; that his real intention was to lead them along
      slowly, so that in a few hundred years they would be induced to admit that
      larceny and murder and polygamy and slavery were not virtues. I suppose if
      we now wished to break a cannibal of the bad habit of devouring
      missionaries, we would first induce him to cook them in a certain way,
      saying: "To eat cooked missionary is one step in advance of eating your
      missionary raw. After a few years, a little mutton could be cooked with
      missionary, and year after year the amount of mutton could be increased
      and the amount of missionary decreased, until in the fullness of time the
      dish could be entirely mutton, and after that the missionaries would be
      absolutely safe."
    </p>
<p>
      If there is anything of value, it is liberty—liberty of body,
      liberty of mind. The liberty of body is the reward of labor. Intellectual
      liberty is the air of the soul, the sunshine of the mind, and without it,
      the world is a prison, the universe a dungeon.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Bible is really inspired, Jehovah commanded the Jewish people to
      buy the children of the strangers that sojourned among them, and ordered
      that the children thus bought should be an inheritance for the children of
      the Jews, and that they should be bondmen and bondwomen forever. Yet
      Epictetus, a man to whom no revelation was ever made, a man whose soul
      followed only the light of nature, and who had never heard of the Jewish
      God, was great enough to say: "Will you not remember that your servants
      are by nature your brothers, the children of God? In saying that you have
      bought them, you look down on the earth, and into the pit, on the wretched
      law of men long since dead, but you see not the laws of the gods."
    </p>
<p>
      We find that Jehovah, speaking to his chosen people, assured them that
      their bondmen and their bondmaids must be "of the heathen that were round
      about them." "Of them," said Jehovah, "shall ye buy bondmen and
      bondmaids." And yet Cicero, a pagan, Cicero, who had never been
      enlightened by reading the Old Testament, had the moral grandeur to
      declare: "They who say that we should love our fellow-citizens but not
      foreigners, destroy the universal brotherhood of mankind, with which
      benevolence and justice would perish forever."
    </p>
<p>
      If the Bible is inspired, Jehovah, God of all worlds, actually said: "And
      if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die under his
      hand, he shall be sorely punished; notwithstanding, if he continue a day
      or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money." And yet Zeno,
      founder of the Stoics, centuries before Christ was born, insisted that no
      man could be the owner of another, and that the title was bad, whether the
      slave had become so by conquest or by purchase.
    </p>
<p>
      Jehovah ordered a Jewish general to make war, and gave, among others, this
      command: "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt
      smite them and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with
      them, nor show mercy unto them." And yet Epictetus, whom we have already
      quoted, gave this marvelous rule for the guidance of human conduct: "Live
      with thy inferiors as thou wouldst have thy superiors live with thee."
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible, after all, that a being of infinite goodness and wisdom
      said: "I will heap mischief upon them; I will send mine arrows upon them;
      they shall be burned with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with
      bitter destruction. I will send the tooth of beasts upon them, with the
      poison of serpents of the dust. The sword without, and terror within,
      shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also, with
      the man of gray hairs" while Seneca, an uninspired Roman, said: "The wise
      man will not pardon any crime that ought to be punished, but he will
      accomplish, in a nobler way, all that is sought in pardoning. He will
      spare some and watch over some, because of their youth, and others on
      account of their ignorance. His clemency will not fall short of justice,
      but will fulfill it perfectly."
    </p>
<p>
      Can we believe that God ever said to any one: "Let his children be
      fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be continually
      vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their desolate
      places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath, and let the stranger
      spoil his labor; let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let
      there be any to favor his fatherless children." If he ever said these
      words, surely he had never heard this line, this strain of music from the
      Hindu: "Sweet is the lute to those who have not heard the prattle of their
      own children."
    </p>
<p>
      Jehovah, "from the clouds and darkness of Sinai," said to the Jews: "Thou
      shalt have no other gods before me.... Though shalt not bow down thyself
      to them nor serve them; for I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God,
      visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third
      and fourth generation of them that hate me." Contrast this with the words
      put by the Hindu in the mouth of Brahma: "I am the same to all mankind.
      They who honestly serve other gods involuntarily worship me. I am he who
      partakest of all worship, and I am the reward of all worshipers."
    </p>
<p>
      Compare these passages; the first a dungeon where crawl the things begot
      of jealous slime; the other, great as the domed firmament inlaid with
      suns. Is it possible that the real God ever said:
    </p>
<p>
      "And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I, the Lord,
      have deceived that prophet; and I will stretch out my hand upon him and
      will destroy him from the midst of my people." Compare that passage with
      one from a Pagan.
    </p>
<p>
      "It is better to keep silence for the remainder of your life than to speak
      falsely."
    </p>
<p>
      Can we believe that a being of infinite mercy gave this command:
    </p>
<p>
      "Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate,
      throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his
      companion, and every man his neighbor; consecrate yourselves to-day to the
      Lord, even every man upon his son and upon his brother, that he may bestow
      a blessing upon you this day."
    </p>
<p>
      Surely, that God was not animated by so great and magnanimous a spirit as
      was Antoninus, a Roman emperor, who declared that, "he had rather keep a
      single Roman citizen alive than slay a thousand enemies."
    </p>
<p>
      Compare the laws given to the children of Israel, as it is claimed by the
      Creator of us all, with the following from Marcus Aurelius:
    </p>
<p>
      "I have formed the ideal of a state, in which there is the same law for
      all, and equal rights, and equal liberty of speech established; an empire
      where nothing is honored so much as the freedom of the citizen."
    </p>
<p>
      In the Avesta I find this: "I belong to five: to those who think good, to
      those who speak good, to those who do good, to those who hear, and to
      those who are pure."
    </p>
<p>
      "Which is the one prayer which in greatness, goodness, and beauty is worth
      all that is between heaven and earth and between this earth and the stars?
      And he replied: To renounce all evil thoughts and words and works."
    </p>
<p>
      VII.
    </p>
<p>
      IT is claimed by the Christian world that one of the great reasons for
      giving an inspired book to the Jews was, that through them the world might
      learn that there is but one God. This piece of information has been
      supposed to be of infinite value. As a matter of fact, long before Moses
      was born, the Egyptians believed and taught that there was but one God—that
      is to say, that above all intelligences there was the one Supreme. They
      were guilty, too, of the same inconsistencies of modern Christians. They
      taught the doctrine of the Trinity—God the Father, God the Mother,
      and God the Son. God was frequently represented as father, mother and
      babe. They also taught that the soul had a divine origin; that after death
      it was to be judged according to the deeds done in the body; that those
      who had done well passed into perpetual joy, and those who had done evil
      into endless pain. In this they agreed with the most approved divine of
      the nineteenth century. Women were the equals of men, and Egypt was often
      governed by queens. In this, her government was vastly better than the one
      established by God. The laws were administered by courts much like ours.
      In Egypt there was a system of schools that gave the son of poverty a
      chance of advancement, and the highest offices were open to the successful
      scholar. The Egyptian married one wife. The wife was called "the lady of
      the house." The women were not secluded. The people were not divided into
      castes. There was nothing to prevent the rise of able and intelligent
      Egyptians. But like the Jehovah of the Jews, they made slaves of the
      captives of war.
    </p>
<p>
      The ancient Persians believed in one God; and women helped to found the
      Parsee religion. Nothing can exceed some of the maxims of Zoroaster. The
      Hindoos taught that above all, and over all, was one eternal Supreme. They
      had a code of laws. They understood the philosophy of evidence and of
      damages. They knew better than to teach the doctrine of an eye for an eye,
      and a tooth for a tooth.
    </p>
<p>
      They knew that when one man maimed another, it was not to the interest of
      society to have that man maimed, thus burdening the people with two
      cripples, but that it was better to make the man who maimed the other work
      to support him. In India, upon the death of a father, the daughters
      received twice as much from the estate as the sons.
    </p>
<p>
      The Romans built temples to Truth, Faith, Valor, Concord, Modesty, and
      Charity, in which they offered sacrifices to the highest conceptions of
      human excellence. Women had rights; they presided in the temple; they
      officiated in holy offices; they guarded the sacred fires upon which the
      safety of Rome depended; and when Christ came, the grandest figure in the
      known world was the Roman mother.
    </p>
<p>
      It will not do to say that some rude statue was made by an inspired
      sculptor, and that the Apollo of Belvidere, Venus de Milo, and the
      Gladiator were made by unaided men; that the daubs of the early ages were
      painted by divine assistance, while the Raphaels, the Angelos, and the
      Rembrandts did what they did without the help of heaven. It will not do to
      say, that the first hut was built by God, and the last palace by degraded
      man; that the hoarse songs of the savage tribes were made by the Deity,
      but that Hamlet and Lear were written by man; that the pipes of Pan were
      invented in heaven, and all other musical instruments on the earth.
    </p>
<p>
      If the Jehovah of the Jews had taken upon himself flesh, and dwelt as a
      man among the people had he endeavored to govern, had he followed his own
      teachings, he would have been a slaveholder, a buyer of babes, and a
      beater of women. He would have waged wars of extermination. He would have
      killed grey-haired and trembling age, and would have sheathed his sword,
      in prattling, dimpled babes. He would have been a polygamist, and would
      have butchered his wife for differing with him on the subject of religion.
    </p>
<p>
      VIII. THE NEW TESTAMENT.
    </p>
<p>
      NE great objection to the Old Testament is the cruelty said to have been
      commanded by God. All these cruelties ceased with death. The vengeance of
      Jehovah stopped at the tomb. He never threatened to punish the dead; and
      there is not one word, from the first mistake in Genesis to the last curse
      of Malachi, containing the slightest intimation that God will take his
      revenge in another world. It was reserved for the New Testament to make
      known the doctrine of eternal pain. The teacher of universal benevolence
      rent the veil between time and eternity, and fixed the horrified gaze of
      man upon the lurid gulf of hell. Within the breast of non-resistance
      coiled the worm that never dies. Compared with this, the doctrine of
      slavery, the wars of extermination, the curses, the punishments of the Old
      Testament were all merciful and just.
    </p>
<p>
      There is no time to speak of the conflicting statements in the various
      books composing the New Testament—no time to give the history of the
      manuscripts, the errors in translation, the interpolations made by the
      fathers and by their successors, the priests, and only time to speak of a
      few objections, including some absurdities and some contradictions.
    </p>
<p>
      Where several witnesses testify to the same transaction, no matter how
      honest they may be, they will disagree upon minor matters, and such
      testimony is generally considered as evidence that the witnesses have not
      conspired among themselves. The differences in statement are accounted for
      from the facts that all do not see alike, and that all have not equally
      good memories; but when we claim that the witnesses are inspired, we must
      admit that he who inspired them did know exactly what occurred, and
      consequently there should be no disagreement, even in the minutest detail.
      The accounts should not only be substantially, but they should be
      actually, the same. The differences and contradictions can be accounted
      for by the weaknesses of human nature, but these weaknesses cannot be
      predicated of divine wisdom.
    </p>
<p>
      And here let me ask: Why should there have been more than one correct
      account of what really happened? Why were four gospels necessary? It seems
      to me that one inspired gospel, containing all that happened, was enough.
      Copies of the one correct one could have been furnished to any extent.
      According to Doctor Davidson, Irenæus argues that the gospels were
      four in number, because there are four universal winds, four corners of
      the globe. Others have said, because there are four seasons; and these
      gentlemen might have added, because a donkey has four legs. For my part, I
      cannot even conceive of a reason for more than one gospel.
    </p>
<p>
      According to one of these gospels, and according to the prevalent
      Christian belief, the Christian religion rests upon the doctrine of the
      atonement. If this doctrine is without foundation, the fabric falls; and
      it is without foundation, for it is repugnant to justice and mercy. The
      church tells us that the first man committed a crime for which all others
      are responsible. This absurdity was the father and mother of another—that
      a man can be rewarded for the good action of another. We are told that God
      made a law, with the penalty of eternal death. All men, they tell us, have
      broken this law. The law had to be vindicated. This could be done by
      damning everybody, but through what is known as the atonement the
      salvation of a few was made possible. They insist that the law demands the
      extreme penalty, that justice calls for its victim, that mercy ceases to
      plead, and that God by allowing the innocent to suffer in the place of the
      guilty settled satisfactory with the law. To carry out this scheme God was
      born as a babe, grew in stature, increased in knowledge, and at the age of
      thirty-three years having lived a life filled with kindness, having
      practiced every virtue, he was sacrificed as an atonement for man. It is
      claimed that he took our place, bore our sins, our guilt, and in this way
      satisfied the justice of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Under the Mosaic dispensation there was no remission of sin except through
      the shedding of blood. When a man sinned he must bring to the priest a
      lamb, a bullock, a goat, or a pair of turtle-doves.
    </p>
<p>
      The priest would lay his hand upon the animal and the sin of the man would
      be transferred to the beast. Then the animal would be killed in place of
      the sinner, and the blood thus shed would be sprinkled upon the altar. In
      this way Jehovah was satisfied. The greater the crime, the greater the
      sacrifice. There was a ratio between the value of the animal and the
      enormity of the sin.
    </p>
<p>
      The most minute directions were given as to the killing of these animals.
      Every priest became a butcher, every synagogue a slaughter-house. Nothing
      could be more utterly shocking to a refined soul, nothing better
      calculated to harden the heart, than the continual shedding of innocent
      blood. This terrible system culminated in the sacrifice of Christ. His
      blood took the place of all other. It is not necessary to shed any more.
      The law at last is satisfied, satiated, surfeited.
    </p>
<p>
      The idea that God wants blood is at the bottom of the atonement, and rests
      upon the most fearful savagery; and yet the Mosaic dispensation was better
      adapted to prevent the commission of sin than the Christian system. Under
      that dispensation, if you committed a sin, you had to bring a sacrifice—dove,
      sheep, or bullock, now, when a sin is committed, the Christian says,
      "Charge it," "Put it on the slate, If I don't pay it the Savior will." In
      this way, rascality is sold on a credit, and the credit system of religion
      breeds extravagance in sin. The Mosaic dispensation was based upon far
      better business principles. The debt had to be paid, and by the man who
      owed it. We are told that the sinner is in debt to God, and that the
      obligation is discharged by the Savior. The best that can be said of such
      a transaction is that the debt is transferred, not paid. As a matter of
      fact, the sinner is in debt to the person he has injured. If you injure a
      man, it is not enough to get the forgiveness of God—you must get the
      man's forgiveness, you must get your own. If a man puts his hand in the
      fire and God forgives him, his hand will smart just as badly. You must
      reap what you sow. No God can give you wheat when you sow tares, and no
      Devil can give you tares when you sow wheat. We must remember that in
      nature there are neither rewards nor punishments—there are
      consequences. The life and death of Christ do not constitute an atonement.
      They are worth the example, the moral force, the heroism of benevolence,
      and in so far as the life of Christ produces emulation in the direction of
      goodness, it has been of value to mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      To make innocence suffer is the greatest sin, and it may be the only sin.
      How, then, is it possible to make the consequences of sin an atonement for
      sin, when the consequences of sin are to be borne by one who has not
      sinned, and the one who has sinned is to reap the reward of virtue? No
      honorable man should be willing that another should suffer for him. No
      good law can accept the sufferings of innocence as an atonement for the
      guilty; and besides, if there was no atonement until the crucifixion of
      Christ, what became of the countless millions who died before that time?
      We must remember that the Jews did not kill animals for the Gentiles.
      Jehovah hated foreigners. There was no way provided for the forgiveness of
      a heathen. What has become of the millions who have died since, without
      having heard of the atonement? What becomes of those who hear and do not
      believe? Can there be a law that demands that the guilty be rewarded. And
      yet, to reward the guilty is far nearer justice than to punish the
      innocent. If the doctrine of the atonement is true, there would have been
      no heaven had no atonement been made.
    </p>
<p>
      If Judas had understood the Christian system, if he knew that Christ must
      be betrayed, and that God was depending on him to betray him, and that
      without the betrayal no human soul could be saved, what should Judas have
      done?
    </p>
<p>
      Jehovah took special charge of the Jewish people. He did this for the
      purpose of civilizing them. If he had succeeded in civilizing them, he
      would have made the damnation of the entire human race a certainty;
      because if the Jews had been a civilized people when Christ appeared—a
      people who had not been hardened by the laws of Jehovah—they would
      not have crucified Christ, and as a consequence, the world would have been
      lost. If the Jews had believed in religious freedom, in the rights of
      thought and speech, if the Christian religion is true, not a human soul
      ever could have been saved. If, when Christ was on his way to Calvary,
      some brave soul had rescued him from the pious mob, he would not only have
      been damned for his pains, but would have rendered impossible the
      salvation of any human being.
    </p>
<p>
      The Christian world has been trying for nearly two thousand years to
      explain the atonement, and every effort has ended in an admission that it
      cannot be understood, and a declaration that it must be believed. Has the
      promise and hope of forgiveness ever prevented the commission of a sin?
      Can men be made better by being taught that sin gives happiness here; that
      to live a virtuous life is to bear a cross; that men can repent between
      the last sin and the last breath; and that repentance washes every stain
      of the soul away? Is it good to teach that the serpent of regret will not
      hiss in the ear of memory; that the saved will not even pity the victims
      of their crimes; and that sins forgiven cease to affect the unhappy
      wretches sinned against?
    </p>
<p>
      Another objection is, that a certain belief is necessary to save the soul.
      This doctrine, I admit, is taught in the gospel according to John, and in
      many of the epistles; I deny that it is taught in Matthew, Mark, or Luke.
      It is, however, asserted by the church that to believe is the only safe
      way. To this, I reply: Belief is not a voluntary thing. A man believes or
      disbelieves in spite of himself. They tell us that to believe is the safe
      way; but I say, the safe way is to be honest. Nothing can be safer than
      that. No man in the hour of death ever regretted having been honest. No
      man when the shadows of the last day were gathering about the pillow of
      death, ever regretted that he had given to his fellow-man his honest
      thought. No man, in the presence of eternity, ever wished that he had been
      a hypocrite. No man ever then regretted that he did not throw away his
      reason. It certainly cannot be necessary to throw away your reason to save
      your soul, because after that, your soul is not worth saving. The soul has
      a right to defend itself. My brain is my castle; and when I waive the
      right to defend it, I become an intellectual serf and slave.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not admit that a man by doing me an injury can place me under
      obligations to do him a service. To render benefits for injuries is to
      ignore all distinctions between actions. He who treats friends and enemies
      alike has neither love nor justice. The idea of non-resistance never
      occurred to a man with power to defend himself. The mother of this
      doctrine was weakness. To allow a crime to be committed, even against
      yourself, when you can prevent it, is next to committing the crime
      yourself. The church has preached the doctrine of non-resistance, and
      under that banner has shed the blood of millions. In the folds of her
      sacred vestments have gleamed for centuries the daggers of assassination.
      With her cunning hands she wove the purple for hypocrisy and placed the
      crown upon the brow of crime. For more than a thousand years larceny held
      the scales of justice, hypocrisy wore the mitre and tiara, while beggars
      scorned the royal sons of toil, and ignorant fear denounced the liberty of
      thought.

      XI. CHRIST'S MISSION.
    </p>
<p>
      HE came, they tell us, to make a revelation, and what did he reveal? "Love
      thy neighbor as thyself"? That was in the Old Testament. "Love God with
      all thy heart"? That was in the Old Testament. "Return good for evil"?
      That was said by Buddha, seven hundred years before Christ was born. "Do
      unto others as ye would that they should do unto you"? That was the
      doctrine of Lao-tsze. Did he come to give a rule of action? Zoroaster had
      done this long before: "Whenever thou art in doubt as to whether an action
      is good or bad, abstain from it." Did he come to tell us of another world?
      The immortality of the soul had been taught by the Hindoos, Egyptians,
      Greeks, and Romans hundreds of years before he was born. What argument did
      he make in favor of immortality? What facts did he furnish? What star of
      hope did he put above the darkness of this world? Did he come simply to
      tell us that we should not revenge ourselves upon our enemies? Long
      before, Socrates had said: "One who is injured ought not to return the
      injury, for on no account can it be right to do an injustice; and it is
      not right to return an injury, or to do evil to any man, however much we
      have suffered from him." And Cicero had said: "Let us not listen to those
      who think we ought to be angry with our enemies, and who believe this to
      be great and manly. Nothing is so praiseworthy, nothing so clearly shows a
      great and noble soul, as clemency and readiness to forgive." Is there
      anything in the literature of the world more nearly perfect than this
      thought?
    </p>
<p>
      Was it from Christ the world learned the first lesson of forbearance, when
      centuries and centuries before, Chrishna had said, "If a man strike thee,
      and in striking drop his staff, pick it up and hand it to him again?" Is
      it possible that the son of God threatened to say to a vast majority, of
      his children, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared
      for the devil and his angels," while the Buddhist was great and tender
      enough to say:
    </p>
<p>
      "Never will I seek nor receive private individual salvation; never enter
      into final peace alone; but forever and everywhere will I live and strive
      for the universal redemption of every creature throughout all worlds.
      Never will I leave this world of sin and sorrow and struggle until all are
      delivered. Until then, I will remain and suffer where I am?"
    </p>
<p>
      Is there anything in the New Testament as beautiful as this, from a Sufi?—"Better
      one moment of silent contemplation and inward love than seventy thousand
      years of outward worship."
    </p>
<p>
      Is there anything comparable to this?—"Whoever carelessly treads on
      a worm that crawls on the earth, that heartless one is darkly alienate
      from God."
    </p>
<p>
      Is there anything in the New Testament more beautiful than the story of
      the Sufi?
    </p>
<p>
      For seven years a Sufi practised every virtue, and then he mounted the
      three steps that lead to the doors of Paradise. He knocked and a voice
      said: "Who is there?" The Sufi replied: "Thy servant, O God." But the
      doors remained closed.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet seven other years the Sufi engaged in every good work. He comforted
      the sorrowing and divided his substance with the poor. Again he mounted
      the three steps, again knocked at the doors of Paradise, and again the
      voice asked: "Who is there?" and the Sufi replied: "Thy slave, O God."—But
      the doors remained closed.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet seven other years the Sufi spent in works of charity, in visiting the
      imprisoned and the sick. Again he mounted the steps, again knocked at the
      celestial doors. Again he heard the question: "Who is there?" and he
      replied: "Thyself, O God."—The gates wide open flew.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible that St. Paul was inspired of God, when he said: "Let the
      women learn in silence, with all subjection."—"Neither was the man
      created for the woman, but the woman for the man?"
    </p>
<p>
      And is it possible that Epictetus, without the slightest aid from heaven,
      gave to the world this gem of love:
    </p>
<p>
      "What is more delightful than to be so dear to your wife, as to be on that
      account dearer to yourself?"
    </p>
<p>
      Did St. Paul express the sentiments of God when he wrote—
    </p>
<p>
      "But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the
      head of every woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. Wives,
      submit yourselves unto your husbands as unto the Lord?"
    </p>
<p>
      And was the author of this, a poor despised heathen?—
    </p>
<p>
      "In whatever house the husband is contented with the wife, and the wife
      with the husband, in that house will fortune dwell; but upon the house
      where women are not honored, let a curse be pronounced. Where the wife is
      honored, there the gods are truly worshiped."
    </p>
<p>
      Is there anything in the New Testament as beautiful as this?—
    </p>
<p>
      "Shall I tell thee where nature is most blest and fair? It is where those
      we love abide. Though that space be small, it is ample above kingdoms;
      though it be a desert, through it run the rivers of Paradise."
    </p>
<p>
      After reading the curses pronounced in the Old
    </p>
<p>
      Testament upon Jew and heathen, the descriptions of slaughter, of
      treachery and of death, the destruction of women and babes; after you
      shall have read all the chapters of horror in the New Testament, the
      threatenings of fire and flame, then read this, from the greatest of human
      beings:
    </p>
<pre>
     "The quality of mercy is not strained:
     It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
     Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed;
     It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
     'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
     The throned monarch better than his crown."
</pre>
<p>
      X. ETERNAL PAIN
    </p>
<p>
      UPON passages in the New Testament rests the doctrine of eternal pain.
      This doctrine subverts every idea of justice. A finite being can neither
      commit an infinite sin, nor a sin against the Infinite. A being of
      infinite goodness and wisdom has no right to create any being whose life
      is not a blessing. Infinite wisdom has no right to create a failure, and
      surely a man destined to everlasting failure is not a conspicuous success.
      The doctrine of eternal punishment is the most infamous of all doctrines—born
      of ignorance, cruelty and fear. Around the angel of immortality,
      Christianity has coiled this serpent.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon Love's breast the church has placed the eternal asp. And yet in the
      same book in which is taught this most frightful of dogmas, we are assured
      that "the Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his
      works."
    </p>
<p>
      A few days ago upon the wide sea, was found a barque called "The Tiger,"
      Captain Kreuger, in command. The vessel had been one hundred and
      twenty-six days upon the sea. For days the crew had been without water,
      without food, and were starving. For nine days not a drop had passed their
      lips. The crew consisted of the captain, a mate, and eleven men. At the
      end of one hundred and eighteen days from Liverpool they killed the
      captain's Newfoundland dog. This lasted them four days. During the next
      five days they had nothing. For weeks they had had no light and were
      unable to see the compass at night. On the one hundred and twenty-fifth
      day Captain Kreuger, a German, took a revolver in his hand, stood up
      before the men, and placing the weapon at his temple said: "Boys, we can't
      stand this much longer, and to save you all, I am willing to die." The
      mate grasped the revolver and begged the captain to wait another day. The
      next day, upon the horizon of their despair, they saw the smoke of the
      steamship Nebo. They were rescued.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose that Captain Kreuger was not a Christian, and suppose that he had
      sent the ball crashing through his brain, and had done so simply to keep
      the crew from starvation, do you tell me that a God of infinite mercy
      would forever damn that man?
    </p>
<p>
      Do not misunderstand me. I insist that every passage in the Bible
      upholding crime was written by savage man. I insist that if there is a
      God, he is not, never was, and never will be in favor of slavery,
      polygamy, wars of extermination, or religious persecution. Does any
      Christian believe that if the real God were to write a book now, he would
      uphold the crimes commanded in the Old Testament? Has Jehovah improved?
      Has infinite mercy become more merciful? Has infinite wisdom
      intellectually advanced?
    </p>
<p>
      WILL any one claim that the passages upholding slavery have liberated
      mankind? Are we indebted to polygamy for our modern homes? Was religious
      liberty born of that infamous verse in which the husband is commanded to
      kill his wife for worshiping an unknown God?
    </p>
<p>
      The usual answer to these objections is, that no country has ever been
      civilized without a Bible. The Jews were the only people to whom Jehovah
      made his will directly known. Were they better than other nations? They
      read the Old Testament and one of the effects of such reading was, that
      they crucified a kind, loving, and perfectly innocent man. Certainly they
      could not have done worse, without a Bible. In crucifying Christ the Jews
      followed the teachings of his Father. If Jehovah was in fact God, and if
      that God took upon himself flesh and came among the Jews, and preached
      what the Jews understood to be blasphemy; and if the Jews in accordance
      with the laws given by this same Jehovah to Moses, crucified him, then I
      say, and I say it with infinite reverence, he reaped what he had sown. He
      became the victim of his own injustice.
    </p>
<p>
      But I insist that these things are not true. I insist that the real God,
      if there is one, never commanded man to enslave his fellow-man, never told
      a mother to sell her babe, never established polygamy, never urged one
      nation to exterminate another, and never told a husband to kill his wife
      because she suggested the worship of another God.
    </p>
<p>
      From the aspersions of the pulpit, from the slanders of the church, I seek
      to rescue the reputation of the Deity. I insist that the Old Testament
      would be a better book with all these passages left out; and whatever may
      be said of the rest of the Bible, the passages to which I have called
      attention can, with vastly more propriety, be attributed to a devil than
      to a god.
    </p>
<p>
      Take from the New Testament the idea that belief is necessary to
      salvation; that Christ was offered as an atonement for the sins of
      mankind; that heaven is the reward of faith, and hell the penalty of
      honest investigation, and that the punishment of the human soul will go on
      forever; take from it all miracles and foolish stories, and I most
      cheerfully admit that the good passages are true. If they are true, it
      makes no difference whether they are inspired or not. Inspiration is only
      necessary to give authority to that which is repugnant to human reason.
      Only that which never happened needs to be substantiated by a miracle.
    </p>
<p>
      The universe is natural.
    </p>
<p>
      The church must cease to insist that passages upholding the institutions
      of savage men were inspired of God. The dogma of atonement must be
      abandoned. Good deeds must take the place of faith. The savagery of
      eternal punishment must be renounced. It must be admitted that credulity
      is not a virtue, and that investigation is not a crime. It must be
      admitted that miracles are the children of mendacity, and that nothing can
      be more wonderful than the majestic, unbroken, sublime, and eternal
      procession of causes and effects. Reason must be the arbiter. Inspired
      books attested by miracles cannot stand against a demonstrated fact. A
      religion that does not command the respect of the greatest minds will, in
      a little while, excite the mockery of all.
    </p>
<p>
      A man who does not believe in intellectual liberty is a barbarian. Is it
      possible that God is intolerant? Could there be any progress, even in
      heaven, without intellectual liberty? Is the freedom of the future to
      exist only in perdition? Is it not, after all, barely possible that a man
      acting like Christ can be saved? Is a man to be eternally rewarded for
      believing according to evidence, without evidence, or against evidence?
      Are we to be saved because we are good, or because another was virtuous?
      Is credulity to be winged and crowned, whilst honest doubt is chained and
      damned.
    </p>
<p>
      If Jehovah, was in fact God, he knew the end from the beginning. He knew
      that his Bible would be a breast-work behind which all tyranny and
      hypocrisy would crouch. He knew that his Bible would be the auction-block
      on which women would stand while their babes were sold from their arms. He
      knew that this Bible would be quoted by tyrants; that it would be the
      defence of robbers called kings, and of hypocrites called priests. He knew
      that he had taught the Jewish people nothing of importance. He knew that
      he had found them free and left them slaves. He knew that he had never
      fulfilled a single promise made to them. He knew that while other nations
      had advanced in art and science his chosen people were savage still. He
      promised them the world, and gave them a desert. He promised them liberty
      and he made them slaves. He promised them victory and he gave them defeat.
      He said they should be kings and he made them serfs. He promised them
      universal empire and gave them exile. When one finishes the Old Testament
      he is compelled to say: "Nothing can add to the misery of a nation whose
      king is Jehovah!"
    </p>
<p>
      The Old Testament filled this world with tyranny and injustice, and the
      New gives us a future filled with pain for nearly all of the sons of men.
    </p>
<p>
      The Old Testament describes the hell of the past, and the New the hell of
      the future.
    </p>
<p>
      The Old Testament tells us the frightful things that God has done, the New
      the frightful things that he will do.
    </p>
<p>
      These two books give us the sufferings of the past and the future—the
      injustice, the agony and the tears of both worlds.

<h2>
      ORTHODOXY.
    </h2>
<h3>
      A LECTURE.
    </h3>
<p>
      IT is utterly inconceivable that any man believing in the truth of the
      Christian religion should publicly deny it, because he who believes in
      that religion would believe that, by a public denial, he would peril the
      eternal salvation of his soul. It is conceivable, and without any great
      effort of the mind, that millions who do not believe in the Christian
      religion should openly say that they did. In a country where religion is
      supposed to be in power—where it has rewards for pretence, where it
      pays a premium upon hypocrisy, where it at least is willing to purchase
      silence—it is easily conceivable that millions pretend to believe
      what they do not. And yet I believe it has been charged against myself not
      only that I was insincere, but that I took the side I am on for the sake
      of popularity; and the audience to-night goes far toward justifying the
      accusation.
    </p>
<p>
      Orthodox Religion Dying Out.
    </p>
<p>
      It gives me immense pleasure to say to this audience that orthodox
      religion is dying out of the civilized world. It is a sick man. It has
      been attacked with two diseases—softening of the brain and
      ossification of the heart. It is a religion that no longer satisfies the
      intelligence of this country; that no longer satisfies the brain; a
      religion against which the heart of every civilized man and woman
      protests. It is a religion that gives hope only to a few; that puts a
      shadow upon the cradle; that wraps the coffin in darkness and fills the
      future of mankind with flame and fear. It is a religion that I am going to
      do what little I can while I live to destroy. In its place I want
      humanity, I want good fellowship, I want intellectual liberty—free
      lips, the discoveries and inventions of genius, the demonstrations of
      science—the religion of art, music and poetry—of good houses,
      good clothes, good wages—that is to say, the religion of this world.
    </p>
<p>
      Religious Deaths and Births.
    </p>
<p>
      We must remember that this is a world of progress, a world of perpetual
      change—a succession of coffins and cradles. There is perpetual
      death, and there is perpetual birth. By the grave of the old, forever
      stand youth and joy; and when an old religion dies, a better one is born.
      When we find out that an assertion is a falsehood a shining truth takes
      its place, and we need not fear the destruction of the false. The more
      false we destroy the more room there will be for the true.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a time when the astrologer sought to read in the stars the fate
      of men and nations. The astrologer has faded from the world, but the
      astronomer has taken his place. There was a time when the poor alchemist,
      bent and wrinkled and old, over his crucible endeavored to find some
      secret by which he could change the baser metals into purest gold. The
      alchemist has gone; the chemist took his place; and, although he finds
      nothing to change metals into gold, he finds something that covers the
      earth with wealth. There was a time when the soothsayer and augur
      flourished. After them came the parson and the priest; and the parson and
      the priest must go. The preacher must go, and in his place must come the
      teacher—the real interpreter of Nature. We are done with the
      supernatural. We are through with the miraculous and the impossible. There
      was once the prophet who pretended to read the book of the future. His
      place has been taken by the philosopher, who reasons from cause to effect—who
      finds the facts by which we are surrounded and endeavors to reason from
      these premises and to tell what in all probability will happen. The
      prophet has gone, the philosopher is here. There was a time when man
      sought aid from heaven—when he prayed to the deaf sky. There was a
      time when everything depended on the supernaturalist. That time in
      Christendom is passing away. We now depend upon the naturalist—not
      upon the believer in ancient falsehoods, but on the discoverer of facts—on
      the demonstrater of truths. At last we are beginning to build on a solid
      foundation, and as we progress, the supernatural dies. The leaders of the
      intellectual world deny the existence of the supernatural. They take from
      all superstition its foundation.
    </p>
<p>
      The Religion of Reciprocity.
    </p>
<p>
      Supernatural religion will fade from this world, and in its place we shall
      have reason. In the place of the worship of something we know not of, will
      be the religion of mutual love and assistance—the great religion of
      reciprocity. Superstition must go. Science will remain. The church dies
      hard. The brain of the world is not yet developed. There are intellectual
      diseases as well as physical—there are pestilences and plagues of
      the mind.
    </p>
<p>
      Whenever the new comes the old protests, and fights for its place as long
      as it has a particle of power. We are now having the same warfare between
      superstition and science that there was between the stage coach and the
      locomotive. But the stage coach had to go. It had its day of glory and
      power, but it is gone. It went West. In a little while it will be driven
      into the Pacific. So we find that there is the same conflict between the
      different sects and different schools not only of philosophy but of
      medicine.
    </p>
<p>
      Recollect that everything except the demonstrated truth is liable to die.
      That is the order of Nature. Words die. Every language has a cemetery.
      Every now and then a word dies and a tombstone is erected, and across it
      is written "obsolete." New words are continually being born. There is a
      cradle in which a word is rocked. A thought is married to a sound, and a
      child-word is born. And there comes a time when the word gets old, and
      wrinkled, and expressionless, and is carried mournfully to the grave. So
      in the schools of medicine. You can remember, so can I, when the old
      allopathists, the bleeders and blisterers, reigned supreme. If there was
      anything the matter with a man they let out his blood. Called to the
      bedside, they took him on the point of a lancet to the edge of eternity,
      and then practiced all their art to bring him back. One can hardly imagine
      how perfect a constitution it took a few years ago to stand the assault of
      a doctor. And long after the old practice was found to be a mistake
      hundreds and thousands of the ancient physicians clung to it, carried
      around with them, in one pocket a bottle of jalap, and in the other a
      rusty lancet, sorry that they could not find some patient with faith
      enough to allow the experiment to be made again.
    </p>
<p>
      So these schools, and these theories, and these religions die hard. What
      else can they do? Like the paintings of the old masters, they are kept
      alive because so much money has been invested in them. Think of the amount
      of money that has been invested in superstition! Think of the schools that
      have been founded for the more general diffusion of useless knowledge!
      Think of the colleges wherein men are taught that it is dangerous to
      think, and that they must never use their brains except in the act of
      faith! Think of the millions and billions of dollars that have been
      expended in churches, in temples, and in cathedrals! Think of the
      thousands and thousands of men who depend for their living upon the
      ignorance of mankind! Think of those who grow rich on credulity and who
      fatten on faith! Do you suppose they are going to die without a struggle?
      What are they to do? From the bottom of my heart I sympathize with the
      poor clergyman that has had all his common sense educated out of him, and
      is now to be thrown upon the cold and unbelieving world. His prayers are
      not answered; he gets no help from on high, and the pews are beginning to
      criticise the pulpit. What is the man to do? If he suddenly changes he is
      gone. If he preaches what he really believes he will get notice to quit.
      And yet, if he and the congregation would come together and be perfectly
      honest, they would all admit that they believe little and know nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      Only a little while ago a couple of ladies were riding together from a
      revival, late at night, and one said to the other, as they rode along: "I
      am going to say something that will shock you, and I beg of you never to
      tell it to anybody else. I am going to tell it to you." "Well, what is
      it?" Said she: "I do not believe the Bible." The other replied: "Neither
      do I."

<p>
      I have often thought how splendid it would be if the ministers could but
      come together and say: "Now, let us be honest. Let us tell each other,
      honor bright"—like Dr. Curry, of Chicago, did in the meeting the
      other day—"just what we believe." They tell a story that in the old
      time a lot of people, about twenty, were in Texas in a little hotel, and
      one fellow got up before the fire, put his hands behind him, and said:
      "Boys, let us all tell our real names." If the ministers and their
      congregations would only tell their real thoughts they would find that
      they are nearly as bad as I am, and that they believe as little.

      Orthodoxy dies hard, and its defenders tell us that this fact shows that
      it is of divine origin. Judaism dies hard. It has lived several thousand
      years longer than Christianity. The religion of Mohammed dies hard.
    </p>
<p>
      Buddhism dies hard. Why do all these religions die hard? Because
      intelligence increases slowly.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me whisper in the ear of the Protestant: Catholicism dies hard. What
      does that prove? It proves that the people are ignorant and that the
      priests are cunning.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me whisper in the ear of the Catholic: Protestantism dies hard. What
      does that prove? It proves that the people are superstitious and the
      preachers stupid.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me whisper in all your ears: Infidelity is not dying—it is
      growing—it increases every day. And what does that prove? It proves
      that the people are learning more and more—that they are advancing—that
      the mind is getting free, and that the race is being civilized.

<p>
      The Blows That Have Shattered the Shield and Shivered the Lance of
      Superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      Mohammed.
    </p>
<p>
      Mohammed wrested from the disciples of the cross the fairest part of
      Europe. It was known that he was an impostor, and that fact sowed the
      seeds of distrust and infidelity in the Christian world. Christians made
      an effort to rescue from the infidels the empty sepulchre of Christ. That
      commenced in the eleventh century and ended at the close of the
      thirteenth. Europe was almost depopulated. The fields were left waste, the
      villages were deserted, nations were impoverished, every man who owed a
      debt was discharged from payment if he put a cross upon his breast and
      joined the Crusades. No matter what crime he had committed, the doors of
      the prison were open for him to join the hosts of the cross. They believed
      that God would give them victory, and they carried in front of the first
      Crusade a goat and a goose, believing that both those animals were blessed
      by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. And I may say that those same animals
      are in the lead to-day in the orthodox world. Until the year 1291 they
      endeavored to gain possession of that sepulchre, and finally the hosts of
      Christ were driven back, baffled and beaten,—a poor, miserable,
      religious rabble. They were driven back, and that fact sowed the seeds of
      distrust in Christendom. You know that at that time the world believed in
      trial by battle—that God would take the side of the right—and
      there had been a trial by battle between the cross and the crescent, and
      Mohammed had been victorious. Was God at that time governing the world?
      Was he endeavoring to spread his gospel?
    </p>
<p>
      The Destruction of Art.
    </p>
<p>
      You know that when Christianity came into power it destroyed every statue
      it could lay its ignorant hands upon. It defaced and obliterated every
      painting; it destroyed every beautiful building; it burned the
      manuscripts, both Greek and Latin; it destroyed all the history, all the
      poetry, all the philosophy it could find, and reduced to ashes every
      library that it could reach with its torch. And the result was, that the
      night of the Middle Ages fell upon the human race. But by accident, by
      chance, by oversight, a few of the manuscripts escaped the fury of
      religious zeal; and these manuscripts became the seed, the fruit of which
      is our civilization of to-day. A few statues had been buried; a few forms
      of beauty were dug from the earth that had protected them, and now the
      civilized world is filled with art, the walls are covered with paintings,
      and the niches filled with statuary. A few manuscripts were found and
      deciphered. The old languages were learned, and literature was again born.
      A new day dawned upon mankind. Every effort at mental improvement had been
      opposed by the church, and yet, the few things saved from the general
      wreck—a few poems, a few works of the ancient thinkers, a few forms
      wrought in stone, produced a new civilization destined to overthrow and
      destroy the fabric of superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      The Discovery of America.
    </p>
<p>
      What was the next blow that this church received? The discovery of
      America. The Holy Ghost who inspired men to write the Bible did not know
      of the existence of this continent, never dreamed of the Western
      Hemisphere. The Bible left out half the world. The Holy Ghost did not know
      that the earth is round. He did not dream that the earth is round. He
      believed it was flat, although he made it himself. At that time heaven was
      just beyond the clouds. It was there the gods lived, there the angels
      were, and it was against that heaven that Jacob's ladder leaned when the
      angels went up and down. It was to that heaven that Christ ascended after
      his resurrection. It was up there that the New Jerusalem was, with its
      streets of gold, and under this earth was perdition. There was where the
      devils lived; where a pit was dug for all unbelievers, and for men who had
      brains. I say that for this reason: Just in proportion that you have
      brains, your chances for eternal joy are lessened, according to this
      religion. And just in proportion that you lack brains your chances are
      increased. At last they found that the earth is round. It was
      circumnavigated by Magellan. In 1519 that brave man set sail. The church
      told him: "The earth is flat, my friend; don't go, you may fall off the
      edge." Magellan said: "I have seen the shadow of the earth upon the moon,
      and I have more confidence in the shadow than I have in the church." The
      ship went round. The earth was circumnavigated. Science passed its hand
      above it and beneath it, and where was the old heaven and where was the
      hell? Vanished forever! And they dwell now only in the religion of
      superstition. We found there was no place there for Jacob's ladder to lean
      against; no place there for the gods and angels to live; no place to hold
      the waters of the deluge; no place to which Christ could have ascended.
      The foundations of the New Jerusalem crumbled. The towers and domes fell,
      and in their places infinite space, sown with an infinite number of stars;
      not with New Jerusalems, but with countless constellations.
    </p>
<p>
      Copernicus and Kepler.
    </p>
<p>
      Then man began to grow great, and with that came Astronomy, In 1473
      Copernicus was born. In 1543 his great work appeared. In 1616 the system
      of Copernicus was condemned by the pope, by the infallible Catholic
      Church, and the church was about as near right upon that subject as upon
      any other. The system of Copernicus was denounced. And how long do you
      suppose the church fought that? Let me tell you. It was revoked by Pius
      VII. in the year of grace 1821. For two hundred and seventy-eight years
      after the death of Copernicus the church insisted that his system was
      false, and that the old Bible astronomy was true. Astronomy is the first
      help that we ever received from heaven. Then came Kepler in 1609, and you
      may almost date the birth of science from the night that Kepler discovered
      his first law. That was the break of the day. His first law, that the
      planets do not move in circles but in ellipses; his second law, that they
      describe equal spaces in equal times; his third law, that the squares of
      their periodic times are proportional to the cubes of their distances.
      That man gave us the key to the heavens. He opened the infinite book, and
      in it read three lines.
    </p>
<p>
      I have not time to speak of Galileo, of Leonardo da Vinci, of Bruno, and
      of hundreds of others who contributed to the intellectual wealth of the
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      Special Providence.
    </p>
<p>
      The next thing that gave the church a blow was Statistics. We found by
      taking statistics that we could tell the average length of human life;
      that this human life did not depend upon infinite caprice; that it
      depended upon conditions, circumstances, laws and facts, and that these
      conditions, circumstances, and facts were during long periods of time
      substantially the same. And now, the man who depends entirely upon special
      providence gets his life insured. He has more confidence even in one of
      these companies than he has in the whole Trinity. We found by statistics
      that there were just so many crimes on an average committed; just so many
      crimes of one kind and so many of another; just so many suicides, so many
      deaths by drowning, so many accidents on an average, so many men marrying
      women, for instance, older than themselves; so many murders of a
      particular kind; just the same number of mistakes; and I say to-night,
      statistics utterly demolish the idea of special providence.
    </p>
<p>
      Only the other day a gentleman was telling me of a case of special
      providence. He knew it. He had been the subject of it. A few years ago he
      was about to go on a ship when he was detained. He did not go, and the
      ship was lost with all on board.
    </p>
<p>
      "Yes!" I said, "Do you think the people who were drowned believed in
      special providence?" Think of the infinite egotism of such a doctrine.
      Here is a man that fails to go upon a ship with five hundred passengers
      and they go down to the bottom of the sea—fathers, mothers,
      children, and loving husbands and wives waiting upon the chores of
      expectation. Here is one poor little wretch that did not happen to go! And
      he thinks that God, the Infinite Being, interfered in his poor little
      withered behalf and let the rest all go. That is special providence. Why
      does special providence allow all the crimes? Why are the wife-beaters
      protected, and why are the wives and children left defenceless if the hand
      of God is over us all? Who protects the insane? Why does Providence permit
      insanity? But the church cannot give up special providence. If there is no
      such thing, then no prayers, no worship, no churches, no priests. What
      would become of National Thanksgiving?
    </p>
<p>
      You know we have a custom every year of issuing a proclamation of
      thanksgiving. We say to God, "Although you have afflicted all the other
      countries, although you have sent war, and desolation, and famine on
      everybody else, we have been such good children that you have been kind to
      us, and we hope you will keep on." It does not make a bit of difference
      whether we have good times or not—the thanksgiving is always exactly
      the same. I remember a few years ago a governor of Iowa got out a
      proclamation of that kind. He went on to tell how thankful the people were
      and how prosperous the State had been. There was a young fellow in that
      State who got out another proclamation, saying that he feared the Lord
      might be misled by official correspondence; that the governor's
      proclamation was entirely false; that the State was not prosperous; that
      the crops had been an almost utter failure; that nearly every farm in the
      State was mortgaged, and that if the Lord did not believe him, all he
      asked was that he would send some angel in whom he had confidence, to look
      the matter over and report.
    </p>
<p>
      Charles Darwin.
    </p>
<p>
      This century will be called Darwin's century. He was one of the greatest
      men who ever touched this globe. He has explained more of the phenomena of
      life than all of the religious teachers. Write the name of Charles Darwin
      on the one hand and the name of every theologian who ever lived on the
      other, and from that name has come more light to the world than from all
      of those. His doctrine of evolution, his doctrine of the survival of the
      fittest, his doctrine of the origin of species, has removed in every
      thinking mind the last vestige of orthodox Christianity. He has not only
      stated, but he has demonstrated, that the inspired writer knew nothing of
      this world, nothing of the origin of man, nothing of geology, nothing of
      astronomy, nothing of nature; that the Bible is a book written by
      ignorance—at the instigation of fear. Think of the men who replied
      to him. Only a few years ago there was no person too ignorant to
      successfully answer Charles Darwin; and the more ignorant he was the more
      cheerfully he undertook the task. He was held up to the ridicule, the
      scorn and contempt of the Christian world, and yet when he died, England
      was proud to put his dust with that of her noblest and her grandest.
      Charles Darwin conquered the intellectual world, and his doctrines are now
      accepted facts. His light has broken in on some of the clergy, and the
      greatest man who to-day occupies the pulpit of one of the orthodox:
      churches, Henry Ward Beecher, is a believer in the theories of Charles
      Darwin—a man of more genius than all the clergy of that entire
      church put together.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet we are told in this little creed that orthodox religion is about
      to conquer the world! It will be driven to the wilds of Africa. It must go
      to some savage country; it has lost its hold upon civilization. It is
      unfortunate to have a religion that cannot be accepted by the intellect of
      a nation. It is unfortunate to have a religion against which every good
      and noble heart protests. Let us have a good religion or none. My pity has
      been excited by seeing these ministers endeavor to warp and twist the
      passages of Scripture to fit the demonstrations of science. Of course, I
      have not time to recount all the discoveries and events that have assisted
      in the destruction of superstition. Every fact is an enemy of the church.
      Every fact is a heretic. Every demonstration is an infidel. Everything
      that ever really happened testifies against the supernatural.
    </p>
<p>
      The church teaches that man was created perfect, and that for six thousand
      years he has degenerated. Darwin demonstrated the falsity of this dogma.
      He shows that man has for thousands of ages steadily advanced; that the
      Garden of Eden is an ignorant myth; that the doctrine of original sin has
      no foundation in fact; that the atonement is an absurdity; that the
      serpent did not tempt, and that man did not "fall."
    </p>
<p>
      Charles Darwin destroyed the foundation of orthodox Christianity. There is
      nothing left but faith in what we know could not and did not happen.
      Religion and science are enemies. One is a superstition; the other is a
      fact. One rests upon the false, the other upon the true. One is the result
      of fear and faith, the other of investigation and reason.
    </p>
<p>
      The Creeds.
    </p>
<p>
      I have been talking a great deal about the orthodox religion. Often, after
      having delivered a lecture, I have met some good, religious person who has
      said to me:
    </p>
<p>
      "You do not tell it as we believe it."
    </p>
<p>
      "Well, but I tell it as you have it written in your creed."
    </p>
<p>
      "Oh, we don't mind the creed any more."
    </p>
<p>
      "Then, why do you not change it?"
    </p>
<p>
      "Oh, well, we understand it as it is, and if we tried to change it, maybe
      we would not agree."
    </p>
<p>
      Possibly the creeds are in the best condition now. There is a tacit
      understanding that they do not believe them, that there is a way to get
      around them, and that they can read between the lines; that if they should
      meet now to form new creeds they would fail to agree; and that now they
      can say as they please, except in public. Whenever they do so in public
      the church, in self-defence, must try them; and I believe in trying every
      minister that does not preach the doctrine he agrees to. I have not the
      slightest sympathy with a Presbyterian preacher who endeavors to preach
      infidelity from a Presbyterian pulpit and receives Presbyterian money.
      When he changes his views he should step down and out like a man, and say,
      "I do not believe your doctrine, and I will not preach it. You must hire
      some other man." The Latest Creed.
    </p>
<p>
      But I find that I have correctly interpreted the creeds. There was put
      into my hands the new Congregational creed. I have read it, and I will
      call your attention to it to-night, to find whether that church has made
      any advance; to find whether the sun of science has risen in the heavens
      in vain; whether they are still the children of intellectual darkness;
      whether they still consider it necessary for you to believe something that
      you by no possibility can understand, in order to be a winged angel
      forever. Now, let us see what their creed is. I will read a little of it.
    </p>
<p>
      They commence by saying that they
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>Believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,
      and of all things visible and invisible</i>."
    </p>
<p>
      They say, now, that there is the one personal God; that he is the maker of
      the universe and its ruler. I again ask the old question, Of what did he
      make it? If matter has not existed through eternity, then this God made
      it. Of what did he make it? What did he use for the purpose? There was
      nothing in the universe except this God. What had the God been doing for
      the eternity he had been living? He had made nothing—called nothing
      into existence; never had had an idea, because it is impossible to have an
      idea unless there is something to excite an idea. What had he been doing?
      Why does not the Congregational Church tell us? How do they know about
      this Infinite Being? And if he is infinite how can they comprehend him?
      What good is it to believe in something that you know you do not
      understand, and that you never can understand?
    </p>
<p>
      In the Episcopalian creed God is described as follows:
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts
      or passions</i>."
    </p>
<p>
      Think of that!—without body, parts, or passions.
    </p>
<p>
      I defy any man in the world to write a better description of nothing. You
      cannot conceive of a finer word-painting of a vacuum than "without body,
      parts, or passions." And yet this God, without passions, is angry at the
      wicked every day; this God, without passions, is a jealous God, whose
      anger burneth to the lowest hell. This God, without passions, loves the
      whole human race; and this God, without passions, damns a large majority
      of mankind. This God without body, walked in the Garden of Eden, in the
      cool of the day. This God, without body, talked with Adam and Eve. This
      God, without body, or parts met Moses upon Mount Sinai, appeared at the
      door of the tabernacle, and talked with Moses face to face as a man
      speaketh to his friend. This description of God is simply an effort of the
      church to describe a something of which it has no conception.
    </p>
<p>
      God as a Governor.
    </p>
<p>
      So, too, I find the following:
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>We believe that the Providence of God, by which he executes his
      eternal purposes in the government of the world, is in and over all
      events.</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      Is God the governor of the world? Is this established by the history of
      nations? What evidence can you find, if you are absolutely honest and not
      frightened, in the history of the world, that this universe is presided
      over by an infinitely wise and good God?
    </p>
<p>
      How do you account for Russia? How do you account for Siberia? How do you
      account for the fact that whole races of men toiled beneath the master's
      lash for ages without recompense and without reward? How do you account
      for the fact that babes were sold from the arms of mothers—arms that
      had been reached toward God in supplication? How do you account for it?
      How do you account for the existence of martyrs? How do you account for
      the fact that this God allows people to be burned simply for loving him?
      Is justice always done? Is innocence always acquitted? Do the good
      succeed? Are the honest fed? Are the charitable clothed? Are the virtuous
      shielded? How do you account for the fact that the world has been filled
      with pain, and grief, and tears? How do you account for the fact that
      people have been swallowed by earthquakes, overwhelmned by volcanoes, and
      swept from the earth by storms? Is it easy to account for famine, for
      pestilence and plague if there be above us all a Ruler infinitely good,
      powerful and wise?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not say there is none. I do not know. As I have said before, this is
      the only planet I was ever on. I live in one of the rural districts of the
      universe, and do not know about these things as much as the clergy pretend
      to, but if they know no more about the other world than they do about
      this, it is not worth mentioning.
    </p>
<p>
      How do they answer all this? They say that God "permits" it. What would
      you say to me if I stood by and saw a ruffian beat out the brains of a
      child, when I had full and perfect power to prevent it? You would say
      truthfully that I was as bad as the murderer. Is it possible for this God
      to prevent it? Then, if he does not he is a fiend; he is no god. But they
      say he "permits" it. What for? So that we may have freedom of choice. What
      for? So that God may find, I suppose, who are good and who are bad. Did he
      not know that when he made us? Did he not know exactly just what he was
      making? Why should he make those whom he knew would be criminals? If I
      should make a machine that would walk your streets and take the lives of
      people you would hang me. And if God made a man whom he knew would commit
      murder, then God is guilty of that murder. If God made a man knowing that
      he would beat his wife, that he would starve his children, that he would
      strew on either side of his path of life the wrecks of ruined homes, then
      I say the being who knowingly called that wretch into existence is
      directly responsible. And yet we are to find the providence of God in the
      history of nations. What little I have read shows me that when man has
      been helped, man has done it; when the chains of slavery have been broken,
      they have been broken by man; when something bad has been done in the
      government of mankind, it is easy to trace it to man, and to fix the
      responsibility upon human beings. You need not look to the sky; you need
      throw neither praise nor blame upon gods; you can find the efficient
      causes nearer home—right here.
    </p>
<p>
      The Love of God.
    </p>
<p>
      What is the next thing I find in this creed?
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>We believe that man was made in the image of God, that he might know,
      love, and obey God, and enjoy him forever.</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      I do not believe that anybody ever did love God, because nobody ever knew
      anything about him. We love each other. We love something that we know. We
      love something that our experience tells us is good and great and
      beautiful. We cannot by any possibility love the unknown. We can love
      truth, because truth adds to human happiness. We can love justice, because
      it preserves human joy. We can love charity. We can love every form of
      goodness that we know, or of which we can conceive, but we cannot love the
      infinitely unknown. And how can we be made in the image of something that
      has neither body, parts, nor passions?
    </p>
<p>
      The Fall of Man.
    </p>
<p>
      The Congregational Church has not outgrown the doctrine of "original sin."
      We are told that:
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>Our first parents, by disobedience, fell under the condemnation of
      God, and that all men are so alienated from God that there is no salvation
      from the guilt and power of sin except through God's redeeming power.</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      Is there an intelligent man or woman now in the world who believes in the
      Garden of Eden story? If you find any man who believes it, strike his
      forehead and you will hear an echo. Something is for rent. Does any
      intelligent man now believe that God made man of dust, and woman of a rib,
      and put them in a garden, and put a tree in the midst of it? Was there not
      room outside of the garden to put his tree, if he did not want people to
      eat his apples?
    </p>
<p>
      If I did not want a man to eat my fruit, I would not put him in my
      orchard.
    </p>
<p>
      Does anybody now believe in the story of the serpent? I pity any man or
      woman who, in this nineteenth century, believes in that childish fable.
      Why did Adam and Eve disobey? Why, they were tempted. By whom? The devil.
      Who made the devil? God. What did God make him for? Why did he not tell
      Adam and Eve about this serpent? Why did he not watch the devil, instead
      of watching Adam and Eve? Instead of turning them out, why did he not keep
      him from getting in? Why did he not have his flood first, and drown the
      devil, before he made a man and woman.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, people who call themselves intelligent—professors in
      colleges and presidents of venerable institutions—teach children and
      young men that the Garden of Eden story is an absolute historical fact. I
      defy any man to think of a more childish thing. This God, waiting around
      Eden—knowing all the while what would happen—having made them
      on purpose so that it would happen, then does what? Holds all of us
      responsible, and we were not there. Here is a representative before the
      constituency had been born. Before I am bound by a representative I want a
      chance to vote for or against him; and if I had been there, and known all
      the circumstances, I should have voted "No!" And yet, I am held
      responsible.
    </p>
<p>
      We are told by the Bible and by the churches that through this fall of man
      "<i>Sin and death entered the world?</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      According to this, just as soon as Adam and Eve had partaken of the
      forbidden fruit, God began to contrive ways by which he could destroy the
      lives of his children. He invented all the diseases—all the fevers
      and coughs and colds—all the pains and plagues and pestilences—all
      the aches and agonies, the malaria and spores; so that when we take a
      breath of air we admit into our lungs unseen assassins; and, fearing that
      some might live too long, even under such circumstances, God invented the
      earthquake and volcano, the cyclone and lightning, animalcules to infest
      the heart and brain, so small that no eye can detect—no instrument
      reach. This was all owing to the disobedience of Adam and Eve!
    </p>
<p>
      In his infinite goodness, God invented rheumatism and gout and dyspepsia,
      cancers and neuralgia, and is still inventing new diseases. Not only
      this', but he decreed the pangs of mothers, and that by the gates of love
      and life should crouch the dragons of death and pain. Fearing that some
      might, by accident, live too long, he planted poisonous vines and herbs
      that looked like food. He caught the serpents he had made and gave them
      fangs and curious organs, ingeniously devised to distill and deposit the
      deadly drop. He changed the nature of the beasts, that they might feed on
      human flesh. He cursed a world, and tainted every spring and source of
      joy. He poisoned every breath of air; corrupted even light, that it might
      bear disease on every ray; tainted every drop of blood in human veins;
      touched every nerve, that it might bear the double fruit of pain and joy;
      decreed all accidents and mistakes that maim and hurt and kill, and set
      the snares of life-long grief, baited with present pleasure,—with a
      moment's joy. Then and there he foreknew and foreordained all human tears.
      And yet all this is but the prelude, the introduction, to the infinite
      revenge of the good God. Increase and multiply all human griefs until the
      mind has reached imagination's farthest verge, then add eternity to time,
      and you may faintly tell, but never can conceive, the infinite horrors of
      this doctrine called "The Fall of Man." The Atonement.
    </p>
<p>
      We are further told that:
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>All men are so alienated from God that there is no alleviation from
      the guilt and power of sin except through God's redeeming grace;</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      And that:
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>We believe that the love of God to sinful man has found its highest
      expression in the redemptive work of his Son, who became man, uniting his
      divine nature with our human nature in one person; who was tempted like
      other men and yet without sin, and by his humiliation, his holy obedience,
      his sufferings, his death on the cross, and his resurrection, became a
      perfect redeemer; whose sacrifice of himself for the sins of the world
      declares the righteousness of God, and is the sole and sufficient ground
      of forgiveness and of reconciliation with him</i>."
    </p>
<p>
      The absurdity of the doctrine known as "The Fall of Man," gave birth to
      that other absurdity known as "The Atonement." So that now it is insisted
      that, as we are rightfully charged with the sin of somebody else, we can
      rightfully be credited with the virtues of another. Let us leave out of
      our philosophy both these absurdities. Our creed will read a great deal
      better with both of them out, and will make far better sense.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, in consequence of Adam's sin, everybody is alienated from God. How?
      Why? Oh, we are all depraved, you know; we all do wrong. Well, why? Is
      that because we are depraved? No. Why do we make so many mistakes? Because
      there is only one right way, and there is an almost infinite number of
      wrong ways; and as long as we are not perfect in our intellects we must
      make mistakes. "There is no darkness but ignorance," and alienation, as
      they call it, from God, is simply a lack of intellect. Why were we not
      given better brains? That may account for the alienation.
    </p>
<p>
      The church teaches that every soul that finds its way to the shore of this
      world is against God—naturally hates God; that the little dimpled
      child in the cradle is simply a chunk of depravity. Everybody against God!
      It is a libel upon the human race; it is a libel upon all the men who have
      worked for wife and child; upon all mothers who have suffered and labored,
      wept and worked; upon all the men who have died for their country; upon
      all who have fought for human liberty. Leave out the history of religion
      and there is little left to prove the depravity of man.
    </p>
<p>
      Everybody that comes is against God! Every soul, they think, is like the
      wrecked Irishman, who drifted to an unknown island, and as he climbed the
      shore saw a man and said to him, "Have you a Government here?" The man
      replied "We have." "Well," said he, "I'm forninst it!"
    </p>
<p>
      The church teaches us that such is the attitude of every soul in the
      universe of God. Ought a god to take any credit to himself for making
      depraved people? A god that cannot make a soul that is not totally
      depraved, I respectfully suggest, should retire from the business. And if
      a god has made us, knowing that we are totally depraved, why should we go
      to the same being to be "born again?"
    </p>
<p>
      The Second Birth.
    </p>
<p>
      The church insists that we must be "born again" and that all who are not
      the subjects of this second birth are heirs of everlasting fire. Would it
      not have been much better to have made another Adam and Eve? Would it not
      have been better to change Noah and his people, so that after that a
      second birth would not have been necessary? Why not purify the fountain of
      all human life? Why allow the earth to be peopled with depraved and
      monstrous beings, each one of whom must be re-made, re-formed, and born
      again?
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, even reformation is not enough. If the man who steals becomes
      perfectly honest, that is not enough; if the man who hates his fellow-man,
      changes and loves his fellow-man, that is not enough; he must go through
      that mysterious thing called the second birth; he must be born again. He
      must have faith; he must believe something that he does not understand,
      and experience what they call "conversion." According to the church,
      nothing so excites the wrath of God—nothing so corrugates the brows
      of Jehovah with hatred—as a man relying on his own good works. He
      must admit that he ought to be damned, and that of the two he prefers it,
      before God will consent to save him.
    </p>
<p>
      I met a man the other day, who said to me, "I am a Unitarian
      Universalist." "What do you mean by that?" I asked. "Well," said he, "this
      is what I mean: the Unitarian thinks he is too good to be damned, and the
      Universalist thinks God is too good to damn him, and I believe them both."
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible that the sacrifice of a perfect being was acceptable to
      God? Will he accept the agony of innocence for the punishment of guilt?
      Will he release Barabbas and crucify Christ?
    </p>
<p>
      Inspiration.
    </p>
<p>
      What is the next thing in this great creed?
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>We believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the
      record of God's revelation of Himself, the work of redemption; that they
      were written by men under the special guidance of the holy spirit; that
      they are able to make wise unto salvation; and that they constitute an
      authoritative standard by which religious teaching and human conduct are
      to be regulated and judged.</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      This is the creed of the Congregational Church; that is, the result
      reached by a high-joint commission appointed to draw up a creed for their
      churches; and there we have the statement that the Bible was written "by
      men under the special guidance of the Holy Spirit."
    </p>
<p>
      What part of the Bible? All of it? All of it. And yet what is this Old
      Testament that was written by an infinitely good God? The being who wrote
      it did not know the shape of the world he had made; knew nothing of human
      nature. He commands men to love him, as if one could love upon command.
      The same God upheld the institution of human slavery; and the church says
      that the Bible that upholds that institution was written by men under the
      guidance of the Holy Spirit. Then I disagree with the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      This church tells us that men under the guidance of the Holy Spirit upheld
      the institution of polygamy—I deny it; that under the guidance of
      the Holy Spirit these men upheld wars of extermination and conquest—I
      deny it; that under the guidance of the Holy Spirit these men wrote that
      it was right for a man to destroy the life of his wife if she happened to
      differ with him on the subject of religion—I deny it. And yet that
      is the book now upheld in this creed of the Congregational Church.
    </p>
<p>
      If the devil had written upon the subject of slavery, which side would he
      have taken? Let every minister answer. If you knew the devil had written a
      work on human slavery, in your judgment, would he uphold slavery, or
      denounce it? Would you regard it as any evidence that he ever wrote it, if
      it upheld slavery? And yet, here you have a work upholding slavery, and
      you say that it was written by an infinitely good God! If the devil upheld
      polygamy, would you be surprised? If the devil wanted to kill men for
      differing with him would you be astonished? If the devil told a man to
      kill his wife, would you be shocked? And yet, you say, that is exactly
      what God did. If there be a God, then that creed is blasphemy. That creed
      is a libel upon him who sits on heaven's throne. If there be a God, I ask
      him to write in the book in which my account is kept, that I denied these
      lies for him.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not believe in a slaveholding God! I do not worship a polygamous Holy
      Ghost, nor a Son who threatens eternal pain; I will not get upon my knees
      before any being who commands a husband to slay his wife because she
      expresses her honest thought. Suppose a book should be found old as the
      Old Testament in which slavery, polygamy and war are all denounced, would
      Christians think that it was written by the devil?
    </p>
<p>
      Did it ever occur to you that if God wrote the Old Testament, and told the
      Jews to crucify or kill anybody that disagreed with them on religion, and
      that this God afterward took upon himself flesh and came to Jerusalem, and
      taught a different religion, and the Jews killed him—did it ever
      occur to you that he reaped exactly what he had sown? Did it ever occur to
      you that he fell a victim to his own tyranny, and was destroyed by his own
      hand? Of course I do not believe that any God ever was the author of the
      Bible, or that any God was ever crucified, or that any God was ever
      killed, or ever will be, but I want to ask you that question.
    </p>
<p>
      Take this Old Testament, then, with all its stories of murder and
      massacre; with all its foolish and cruel fables; with all its infamous
      doctrines; with its spirit of caste; with its spirit of hatred, and tell
      me whether it was written by a good God. If you will read the maledictions
      and curses of that book, you will think that God, like Lear, had divided
      heaven among his daughters, and then, in the insanity of despair, had
      launched his curses on the human race.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, I must say—I must admit—that the Old Testament is
      better than the New. In the Old Testament, when God had a man dead, he let
      him alone. When he saw him quietly in his grave he was satisfied. The
      muscles relaxed, and the frown gave place to a smile. But in the New
      Testament the trouble commences at death. In the New Testament God is to
      wreak his revenge forever and ever. It was reserved for one who said,
      "Love your enemies," to tear asunder the veil between time and eternity
      and fix the horrified gaze of man upon the gulfs of eternal fire. The New
      Testament is just as much worse than the Old, as hell is worse than sleep;
      just as much worse, as infinite cruelty is worse than dreamless rest; and
      yet, the New Testament is claimed to be a gospel of love and peace.
    </p>
<p>
      Is it possible that: "<i>The Scriptures constitute the authoritative
      standard by which religious teaching and human conduct are to be regulated
      and judged"?</i>
</p>
<p>
      Are we to judge of conduct by the Old Testament, by the New, or by both?
      According to the Old, the slaveholder was a just and generous man; a
      polygamist was a model of virtue. According to the New, the worst can be
      forgiven and the best can be lost. How can any book be a standard, when
      the standard itself must be measured by human reason? Is there a standard
      of a standard? Must not the reason be convinced? and, if so, is not the
      reason of each man the final arbiter of that man? If he takes a book as a
      standard, does he so take it because it is to him reasonable? In what way
      is the human reason to be ignored? Why should a book take its place,
      unless the reason has been convinced that the book is the proper standard?
      If this is so, the book rests upon the reason of those who adopt it. Are
      they to be saved because they act in accordance with their reason, and are
      others to be damned because they act by the same standard—their
      reason? No two are alike. Can we demand of all the same result? Suppose
      the compasses were not constant to the pole—no two compasses exactly
      alike—would you expect all ships to reach the same harbor?
    </p>
<p>
      The Reign of Truth and Love.
    </p>
<p>
      I also find in this creed the following:
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>We believe that Jesus Christ came to establish among men the Kingdom
      of God, the reign of truth and love, of righteousness and peace!</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      Well, that may have been the object of Jesus Christ. I do not deny it. But
      what was the result? The Christian world has caused more war than all the
      rest of the world beside. Most of the cunning instruments of death have
      been devised by Christians. All the wonderful machinery by which the life
      is blown from men, by which nations are conquered and enslaved—all
      these machines have been born in Christian brains. And yet he came to
      bring peace, they say; but the Testament says otherwise: "I came not to
      bring peace, but a sword." And the sword was brought. What are the
      Christian nations doing to-day in Europe? Is there a solitary Christian
      nation that will trust any other? How many millions of Christians are in
      the uniform of forgiveness, armed with the muskets of love?
    </p>
<p>
      There was an old Spaniard on the bed of death, who sent for a priest, and
      the priest told him that he would have to forgive his enemies before he
      died. He said, "I have none." "What! no enemies?" "Not one," said the
      dying man; "I killed the last one three months ago."
    </p>
<p>
      How many millions of Christians are now armed and equipped to destroy
      their fellow-Christians? Who are the men in Europe crying against war? Who
      wishes to have the nations disarmed? Is it the church? No; the men who do
      not believe in what they call this religion of peace. When there is a war,
      and when they make a few thousand widows and orphans; when they strew the
      plain with dead patriots, Christians assemble in their churches and sing
      "Te Deum Laudamus." Why? Because he has enabled a few of his children to
      kill some others of his children. This is the religion of peace—the
      religion that invented the Krupp gun, that will hurl a ball weighing two
      thousand pounds through twenty-four inches of solid steel. This is the
      religion of peace that covers the sea with men-of-war, clad in mail, in
      the name of universal forgiveness. This is the religion that drills and
      uniforms five millions of men to kill their fellows.
    </p>
<p>
      The Wars It Brought.
    </p>
<p>
      What effect has this religion had upon the nations of the earth? What have
      the nations been fighting about? What was the Thirty Years' War in Europe
      for? What was the war in Holland for? Why was it that England persecuted
      Scotland? Why is it that England persecutes Ireland even to this day? At
      the bottom of every one of these conflicts you will find a religious
      question. The religion of Jesus Christ, as preached by his church, causes
      war, bloodshed, hatred, and all uncharitableness; and why? Because, they
      say, a certain belief is necessary to salvation. They do not say, if you
      behave yourself you will get there; they do not say, if you pay your debts
      and love your wife and love your children, and are good to your friends,
      and your neighbors, and your country, you will get there; that will do you
      no good; you have got to believe a certain thing. No matter how bad you
      are, you can instantly be forgiven; and no matter how good you are, if you
      fail to believe that which you cannot understand, the moment you get to
      the day of judgment nothing is left but to damn you, and all the angels
      will shout "hallelujah."
    </p>
<p>
      What do they teach to-day? Nearly every murderer goes to heaven; there is
      only one step from the gallows to God, only one jerk between the halter
      and heaven. That is taught by this church.
    </p>
<p>
      I believe there ought to be a law to prevent the giving of the slightest
      religious consolation to any man who has been found guilty of murder. Let
      a Catholic understand that if he imbrues his hands in his brother's blood,
      he can have no extreme unction. Let it be understood that he can have no
      forgiveness through the church; and let the Protestant understand that
      when he has committed that crime the community will not pray him into
      heaven. Let him go with his victim. The victim, dying in his sins, goes to
      hell, and the murderer has the happiness of seeing him there. If heaven
      grows dull and monotonous, the murderer can again give life to the nerve
      of pleasure by watching the agony of his victim.
    </p>
<p>
      The truth is, Christianity has not made friends; it has made enemies. It
      is not, as taught, the religion of peace, it is the religion of war. Why
      should a Christian hesitate to kill a man that his God is waiting to damn?
      Why should a Christian not destroy an infidel who is trying to assassinate
      his soul? Why should a Christian pity an unbeliever—one who has
      rejected the Bible—when he knows that God will be pitiless forever?
      And yet we are told, in this creed, that "<i>we believe in the ultimate
      prevalence of the Kingdom of Christ over all the earth.</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      What makes you? Do you judge from the manner in which you are getting
      along now? How many people are being born a year? About fifty millions.
      How many are you converting a year, really, truthfully? Five or six
      thousand. I think I have overstated the number. Is orthodox Christianity
      on the increase? No. There are a hundred times as many unbelievers in
      orthodox Christianity as there were ten years ago. What are you doing in
      the missionary world? How long is it since you converted a Chinaman? A
      fine missionary religion, to send missionaries with their Bibles and
      tracts to China, but if a Chinaman comes here, mob him, simply to show him
      the difference between the practical and theoretical workings of the
      Christian religion. How long since you have had an intelligent convert in
      India? In my judgment, never; there never has been an intelligent Hindoo
      converted from the time the first missionary put his foot on that soil;
      and never, in my judgment, has an intelligent Chinaman been converted
      since the first missionary touched that shore. Where are they? We hear
      nothing of them, except in the reports. They get money from poor old
      ladies, trembling on the edge of the grave, and go and tell them stories,
      how hungry the average Chinaman is for a copy of the New Testament, and
      paint the sad condition of a gentleman in the interior of Africa without
      the works of Dr. McCosh, longing for a copy of <i>The Princeton Review</i>,—in
      my judgment, a pamphlet that would suit a savage. Thus money is scared
      from the dying, and frightened from the old and feeble.
    </p>
<p>
      About how long is it before this kingdom is to be established? No one
      objects to the establishment of peace and good will. Every good man longs
      for the time when war shall cease. We are all hoping for a day of
      universal justice—a day of universal freedom—when man shall
      control himself, when the passions shall become obedient to the
      intelligent will. But the coming of that day will not be hastened by
      preaching the doctrines of total depravity and eternal revenge. That sun
      will not rise the quicker for preaching salvation by faith. The star that
      shines above that dawn, the herald of that day, is Science, not
      superstition,—Reason, not religion.
    </p>
<p>
      To show you how little advance has been made, how many intellectual bats
      and mental owls still haunt the temple, still roost above the altar, I
      call your attention to the fact that the Congregational Church, according
      to this creed; still believes in the resurrection of the dead, and in
      their Confession of Faith, attached to the creed, I find that they also
      believe in the literal resurrection of the body.
    </p>
<p>
      The Resurrection.
    </p>
<p>
      Does anybody believe that, who has the courage to think for himself? Here
      is a man, for instance, that weighs 200 pounds and gets sick and dies
      weighing 120; how much will he weigh in the morning of the resurrection?
      Here is a cannibal, who eats another man; and we know that the atoms you
      eat go into your body and become a part of you. After the cannibal has
      eaten the missionary, and appropriated his atoms to himself, and then
      dies, to whom will the atoms belong in the morning of the resurrection?
      Could the missionary maintain an action of replevin, and if so, what would
      the cannibal do for a body? It has been demonstrated, in so far as logic
      can demonstrate anything, that there is no creation and no destruction in
      Nature. It has been demonstrated, again and again, that the atoms in us
      have been in millions of other beings; have grown in the forests and in
      the grass, have blossomed in flowers, and been in the metals. In other
      words, there are atoms in each one of us that have been in millions of
      others; and when we die, these atoms return to the earth, again appear in
      grass and trees, are again eaten by animals, and again devoured by
      countless vegetable mouths and turned into wood; and yet this church, in
      the nineteenth century,'in a council composed of, and presided over by,
      professors and presidents of colleges and theologians, solemnly tells us
      that it believes in the literal resurrection of the body. This is almost
      enough to make one despair of the future—almost enough to convince a
      man of the immortality of the absurd. They know better. There is not one
      so ignorant but knows better.

<p>
      The Judgment-Day.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is the next thing?
    </p>
<p>
      "<i>We believe in a final judgment, the issues of which are everlasting
      punishment and everlasting life!</i>"
    </p>
<p>
      At the final judgment all of us will be there. The thousands, and
      millions, and billions, and trillions, and quadrillions that have died
      will be there. The books will be opened, and each case will be called. The
      sheep and the goats will be divided. The unbelievers will be sent to the
      left, while the faithful will proudly walk to the right. The saved,
      without a tear, will bid an eternal farewell to those who loved them here—to
      those they loved. Nearly all the human race will go away to everlasting
      punishment, and the fortunate few to eternal life. This is the consolation
      of the Congregational Church! This is the hope that dispels the gloom of
      life!

<p>
      Pious Evasions.
    </p>
<p>
      When the clergy are caught, they give a different meaning to the words and
      say the world was not made in seven days. They say "good whiles"—"epochs."
    </p>
<p>
      And in this same Confession of Faith and in this creed they say that the
      Lord's day is holy—every seventh day. Suppose you lived near the
      North Pole where the day is three months long. Then which day would you
      keep? If you could get to the North Pole you could prevent Sunday from
      ever overtaking you. You could walk around the other way faster than the
      world could revolve. How would you keep Sunday then? Suppose we invent
      something that can go one thousand miles an hour? We can chase Sunday
      clear around the globe. Is there anything that can be more perfectly
      absurd than that a space of time can be holy? You might as well talk about
      a virtuous vacuum. We are now told that the Bible is not a scientific
      book, and that after all we cannot depend on what God said four thousand
      years ago—that his ways are not as our ways—that we must
      accept without evidence, and believe without understanding.
    </p>
<p>
      I heard the other night of an old man. He was not very well educated, and
      he got into the notion that he must have reading of the Bible and family
      worship. There was a bad boy in the family, and they were reading the
      Bible by course. In the fifteenth chapter of Corinthians is this passage:
      "Behold, brethren, I show you a mystery; we shall not all die, but we
      shall all be changed." This boy had rubbed out the "c" in "changed." So
      when the old man put on his spectacles, and got down his Bible, he read:
      "Behold, brethren, I show you a mystery, we shall not all die, but we
      shall all be hanged." The old lady said, "Father, I don't think it reads
      that way." He said, "Who is reading this?" "Yes mother, it says 'hanged,'
      and, more than that, I see the sense of it. Pride is the besetting sin of
      the human heart, and if there is anything calculated to take the pride out
      of a man it is hanging." It is in this way that ministers avoid and
      explain the discoveries of Science.
    </p>
<p>
      People ask me, if I take away the Bible what are we going to do? How can
      we get along without the revelation that no one understands? What are we
      going to do if we have no Bible to quarrel about What are we to do without
      hell? What are we going to do with our enemies? What are we going to do
      with the people we love but don't like?
    </p>
<p>
      "No Bible, No Civilization."
    </p>
<p>
      They tell me that there never would have been any civilization if it had
      not been for this Bible. The Jews had a Bible; the Romans had not. Which
      had the greater and the grander government? Let us be honest. Which of
      those nations produced the greatest poets, the greatest soldiers, the
      greatest orators, the greatest statesmen, the greatest sculptors? Rome had
      no Bible. God cared nothing for the Roman Empire. He let the men come up
      by chance. His time was taken up with the Jewish people. And yet Rome
      conquered the world, including the chosen people of God. The people who
      had the Bible were defeated by the people who had not. How was it possible
      for Lucretius to get along without the Bible?—how did the great and
      glorious of that empire? And what shall we say of Greece? No Bible.
      Compare Athens with Jerusalem. From Athens come the beauty and
      intellectual grace of the world. Compare the mythology of Greece with the
      mythology of Judea; one covering the earth with beauty, and the other
      filling heaven with hatred and injustice. The Hindoos had no Bible; they
      had been forsaken by the Creator, and yet they became the greatest
      metaphysicians of the world. Egypt had no Bible. Compare Egypt with Judea.
      What are we to do without the Bible? What became of the Jews who had a
      Bible? Their temple was destroyed and their city was taken; and they never
      found real prosperity until their God deserted them. The Turks attributed
      all their victories to the Koran. The Koran gave them their victories over
      the believers in the Bible. The priests of each nation have accounted for
      the prosperity of that nation by its religion.
    </p>
<p>
      The Christians mistake an incident for a cause, and honestly imagine that
      the Bible is the foundation of modern liberty and law. They forget
      physical conditions, make no account of commerce, care nothing for
      inventions and discoveries, and ignorantly give the credit to their
      inspired book.
    </p>
<p>
      The foundations of our civilization were laid centuries before
      Christianity was known. The intelligence of courage, of self-government,
      of energy, of industry, that uniting made the civilization of this
      century, did not come alone from Judea, but from every nation of the
      ancient world.

<p>
      Miracles of the New Testament.
    </p>
<p>
      There are many things in the New Testament that I cannot accept as true.
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot believe in the miraculous origin of Jesus Christ. I believe he
      was the son of Joseph and Mary; that Joseph and Mary had been duly and
      legally married; that he was the legitimate offspring of that union.
      Nobody ever believed the contrary until he had been dead at least one
      hundred and fifty years. Neither Matthew, Mark, nor Luke ever dreamed that
      he was of divine origin. He did not say to either Matthew, Mark, or Luke,
      or to any one in their hearing, that he was the Son of God, or that he was
      miraculously conceived. He did not say it. It may be asserted that he said
      it to John, but John did not write the gospel that bears his name. The
      angel Gabriel, who, they say, brought the news, never wrote a word upon
      the subject. The mother of Christ never wrote a word upon the subject. His
      alleged father never wrote a word upon the subject, and Joseph never
      admitted the story. We are lacking in the matter of witnesses. I would not
      believe such a story now. I cannot believe that it happened then. I would
      not believe people I know, much less would I believe people I do not know.
    </p>
<p>
      At that time Matthew and Luke believed that Christ was the son of Joseph
      and Mary. And why? they say he descended from David, and in order to show
      that he was of the blood of David, they gave the genealogy of Joseph. And
      if Joseph was not his father, why did they not give the genealogy of
      Pontius Pilate or of Herod? Could they, by giving the genealogy of Joseph,
      show that he was of the blood of David if Joseph was in no way related to
      Christ? And yet that is the position into which the Christian world is
      driven. In the New Testament we find that in giving the genealogy of
      Christ it says, "who was the son of Joseph?" and the church has
      interpolated the words "as was supposed." Why did they give a supposed
      genealogy? It will not do. And that is a thing that cannot in any way, by
      any human testimony, be established.
    </p>
<p>
      If it is important for us to know that he was the Son of God, I say, then,
      that it devolves upon God to give us the evidence. Let him write it across
      the face of the heavens, in every language of mankind. If it is necessary
      for us to believe it, let it grow on every leaf next year. No man should
      be damned for not believing, unless the evidence is overwhelming. And he
      ought not to be made to depend upon say so, or upon "as was supposed." He
      should have it directly, for himself. A man says that God told him a
      certain thing, and he tells me, and I have only his word. He may have been
      deceived. If God has a message for me he ought to tell it to me, and not
      to somebody that has been dead four or five thousand years, and in another
      language.
    </p>
<p>
      Besides, God may have changed his mind on many things; he has on slavery,
      and polygamy at least, according to the church; and yet his church now
      wants to go and destroy polygamy in Utah with the sword. Why do they not
      send missionaries there with copies of the Old Testament? By reading the
      lives of Abraham and Isaac, and Lot, and a few other patriarchs who ought
      to have been in the penitentiary, maybe they can soften their hearts.
    </p>
<p>
      More Miracles.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another miracle I do not believe,—the resurrection. I want
      to speak about it as we would about any ordinary transaction. In the first
      place, I do not believe that any miracle was ever performed, and if there
      was, you cannot prove it. Why? Because it is altogether more reasonable to
      believe that the people were mistaken about it than that it happened. And
      why? Because, according to human experience, we know that people will not
      always tell the truth, and we never saw a miracle ourselves, and we must
      be governed by our experience; and if we go by our experience, we must say
      that the miracle never happened—that the witnesses were mistaken.
    </p>
<p>
      A man comes into Jerusalem, and the first thing he does is to cure the
      blind. He lets the light of day visit the night of blindness. The eyes are
      opened, and the world is again pictured upon the brain. Another man is
      clothed with leprosy. He touches him and the disease falls from him, and
      he stands pure, and clean, and whole. Another man is deformed, wrinkled,
      and bent. He touches him, and throws around him again the garment of
      youth. A man is in his grave, and he says, "Come forth!" And the man walks
      in life, feeling his heart throb and his blood going joyously through his
      veins. They say that actually happened. I do not know.
    </p>
<p>
      There is one wonderful thing about the dead people that were raised—we
      do not hear of them any more. What became of them? If there was a man in
      this city who had been raised from the dead, I would go to see him
      to-night. I would say, "Where were you when you got the notice to come
      back? What kind of a country is it? What kind of opening there for a young
      man? How did you like it? Did you meet there the friends you had lost? Is
      there a world without death, without pain, without a tear? Is there a land
      without a grave, and where good-bye is never heard?" Nobody ever paid the
      slightest attention to the dead who had been raised. They did not even
      excite interest when they died the second time. Nobody said, "Why, that
      man is not afraid. He has been there once. He has walked through the
      valley of the shadow." Not a word. They pass quietly away.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not believe these miracles. There is something wrong somewhere about
      that business. I may suffer eternal punishment for all this, but I cannot,
      I do not, believe.
    </p>
<p>
      There was a man who did all these things, and thereupon they crucified
      him. Let us be honest. Suppose a man came into this city and should meet a
      funeral procession, and say, "Who is dead?" and they should reply, "The
      son of a widow; her only support." Suppose he should say to the
      procession, "Halt!" and to the undertaker, "Take out that coffin, unscrew
      that lid. Young man, I say unto thee, arise!" and the dead should step
      from the coffin and in a moment afterward hold his mother in his arms.
      Suppose this stranger should go to your cemetery and find some woman
      holding a little child in each hand, while the tears fell upon a new-made
      grave, and he should say to her, "Who lies buried here?" and she should
      reply, "My husband;" and he should cry, "I say unto thee, oh grave, give
      up thy dead!" and the husband should rise, and in a moment after have his
      lips upon his wife's, and the little children with their arms around his
      neck; do you think that the people of this city would kill him? Do you
      think any one would wish to crucify him? Do you not rather believe that
      every one who had a loved one out in that cemetery would go to him, even
      upon their knees, and beg him to give back their dead? Do you believe that
      any man was ever crucified who was the master of death?
    </p>
<p>
      Let me tell you to-night if there shall ever appear upon this earth the
      master, the monarch, of death, all human knees will touch the earth. He
      will not be crucified. All the living who fear death; all the living who
      have lost a loved one, will bow to him. And yet we are told that this
      worker of miracles, this man who could clothe the dead dust in the
      throbbing flesh of life, was crucified. I do not believe that he worked
      the miracles, I do not believe that he raised the dead, I do not believe
      that he claimed to be the Son of God, These things were told long after he
      was dead; told because the ignorant multitude demanded mystery and wonder;
      told, because at that time the miraculous was believed of all the
      illustrious dead. Stories that made Christianity powerful then, weaken it
      now. He who gains a triumph in a conflict with a devil, will be defeated
      by science.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another thing about these foolish miracles. All could have been
      imitated. Men could pretend to be blind; confederates could feign
      sickness, and even death.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not very difficult to limp or to hold an arm as though it were
      paralyzed; or to say that one is afflicted with "an issue of blood." It is
      easy to say that the son of a widow was raised from the dead, and if you
      fail to give the name of the son, or his mother, or the time and place
      where the wonder occurred, it is quite difficult to show that it did not
      happen.
    </p>
<p>
      No one can be called upon to disprove anything that has not apparently
      been established. I say apparently, because there can be no real evidence
      in support of a miracle.
    </p>
<p>
      How could we prove, for instance, the miracle of the loaves and fishes?
      There were plenty of other loaves and other fishes in the world? Each one
      of the five thousand could have had a loaf and a fish with him. We would
      have to show that there was no other possible way for the people to get
      the bread and fish except by miracle, and then we are only half through.
      We must then show that they did, in fact, get enough to feed five thousand
      people, and that more was left than was had in the beginning.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course this is simply impossible. And let me ask, why was not the
      miracle substantiated by some of the multitude?
    </p>
<p>
      Would it not have been a greater wonder if Christ had <i>created</i>
      instead of multiplied the loaves and fishes?
    </p>
<p>
      How can we now prove that a certain person more than eighteen hundred
      years ago was possessed by seven devils?
    </p>
<p>
      How was it ever possible to prove a thing like that?
    </p>
<p>
      How can it be established that some evil spirits could talk while others
      were dumb, and that the dumb ones were the hardest to control?
    </p>
<p>
      If Christ wished to convince his fellow-men by miracles, why did he not do
      something that could not by any means have been a counterfeit?
    </p>
<p>
      Instead of healing a withered arm, why did he not find some man whose arm
      had been cut off, and make another grow?
    </p>
<p>
      If he wanted to raise the dead, why did he not raise some man of
      importance, some one known to all?
    </p>
<p>
      Why did he do his miracles in the obscurity of the village, in the
      darkness of the hovel?
    </p>
<p>
      Why call back to life people so insignificant that the public did not know
      of their death?
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose that in May, 1865, a man had pretended to raise some person by the
      name of Smith from the dead, and suppose a religion had been founded on
      that miracle, would it not be natural for people, hundreds of years after
      the pretended miracle, to ask why the founder of that religion did not
      raise from the dead Abraham Lincoln, instead of the unknown and obscure
      Mr. Smith?
    </p>
<p>
      How could any man now, in any court, by any known rule of evidence,
      substantiate one of the miracles of Christ?
    </p>
<p>
      Must we believe anything that cannot in any way be substantiated?
    </p>
<p>
      If miracles were necessary to convince men eighteen centuries ago, are
      they not necessary now?
    </p>
<p>
      After all, how many men did Christ convince with his miracles? How many
      walked beneath the standard of the master of Nature?
    </p>
<p>
      How did it happen that so many miracles convinced so few? I will tell you.
      The miracles were never performed. No other explanation is possible.
    </p>
<p>
      It is infinitely absurd to say that a man who cured the sick, the halt and
      blind, raised the dead, cast out devils, controlled the winds and waves,
      created food and held obedient to his will the forces of the world, was
      put to death by men who knew his superhuman power and who had seen his
      wondrous works. If the crucifixion was public, the miracles were private.
      If the miracles had been public, the crucifixion could not have been. Do
      away with the miracles, and the superhuman character of Christ is
      destroyed. He becomes what he really was—a man. Do away with the
      wonders, and the teachings of Christ cease to be authoritative. They are
      then worth the reason, the truth that is in them, and nothing more. Do
      away with the miracles, and then we can measure the utterances of Christ
      with the standard of our reason. We are no longer intellectual serfs,
      believing what is unreasonable in obedience to the command of a supposed
      god. We no longer take counsel of our fears, of our cowardice, but boldly
      defend what our reason maintains.
    </p>
<p>
      Christ takes his appropriate place with the other teachers of mankind. His
      life becomes reasonable and admirable. We have a man who hated oppression;
      who despised and denounced superstition and hypocrisy; who attacked the
      heartless church of his time; who excited the hatred of bigots and
      priests, and who rather than be false to his conception of truth, met and
      bravely suffered even death.
    </p>
<p>
      The Resurrection.
    </p>
<p>
      The miracle of the resurrection I do not and cannot believe. If it was the
      fact, if the dead Christ rose from the grave, why did he not appear to his
      enemies? Why did he not visit Pontius Pilate? Why did he not call upon
      Caiaphas, the high priest? upon Herod? Why did he not again enter the
      temple and end the old dispute with demonstration? Why did he not confront
      the Roman soldiers who had taken money to falsely swear that his body had
      been stolen by his friends? Why did he not make another triumphal entry
      into Jerusalem? Why did he not say to the multitude: "Here are the wounds
      in my feet, and in my hands, and in my side. I am the one you endeavored
      to kill, but Death is my slave"? Simply because the resurrection is a
      myth. It makes no difference with his teachings. They are just as good
      whether he wrought miracles or not. Twice two are four; that needs no
      miracle. Twice two are five—a miracle can not help that. Christ's
      teachings are worth their effect upon the human race. It makes no
      difference about miracle or wonder. In that day every one believed in the
      impossible. Nobody had any standing as teacher, philosopher, governor,
      king, general, about whom there was not supposed to be something
      miraculous. The earth was covered with the sons and daughters of gods and
      goddesses.
    </p>
<p>
      In Greece, in Rome, in Egypt, in India, every great man was supposed to
      have had either a god for his father, or a goddess for his mother. They
      accounted for genius by divine origin. Earth and heaven were at that time
      near together. It was but a step for the gods from the blue arch to the
      green earth. Every lake and valley and mountain top was made rich with
      legends of the loves of gods. How could the early Christians have made
      converts to a man, among a people who believed so thoroughly in gods—in
      gods that had lived upon the earth; among a people who had erected temples
      to the sons and daughters of gods? Such people could not have been induced
      to worship a man—a man born among barbarous people, citizen of a
      nation weak and poor and paying tribute to the Roman power. The early
      Christians therefore preached the gospel of a god.
    </p>
<p>
      The Ascension.
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot believe in the miracle of the ascension, in the bodily ascension
      of Jesus Christ. Where was he going? In the light shed upon this question
      by the telescope, I again ask, where was he going?
    </p>
<p>
      The New Jerusalem is not above us. The abode of the gods is not there.
      Where was he going? Which way did he go? Of course that depends upon the
      time of day he left. If he left in the evening, he went exactly the
      opposite way from that he would have gone had he ascended in the morning.
      What did he do with his body? How high did he go? In what way did he
      overcome the intense cold? The nearest station is the moon, two hundred
      and forty thousand miles away. Again I ask, where did he go? He must have
      had a natural body, for it was the same body that died. His body must have
      been material, otherwise he would not as he rose have circled with the
      earth, and he would have passed from the sight of his disciples at the
      rate of more than a thousand miles per hour.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be said that his body was "spiritual." Then what became of the body
      that died? Just before his ascension we are told that he partook of
      broiled fish with his disciples. Was the fish "spiritual?"
    </p>
<p>
      Who saw this miracle?
    </p>
<p>
      They say the disciples saw it. Let us see what they say. Matthew did not
      think it was worth mentioning. He does not speak of it. On the contrary,
      he says that the last words of Christ were:
    </p>
<p>
      "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Is it possible
      that Matthew saw this, the most miraculous of miracles, and yet forgot to
      put it in his life of Christ? Think of the little miracles recorded by
      this saint, and then determine whether it is probable that he witnessed
      the ascension of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
<p>
      Mark says: "So, then, after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received
      up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God." This is all he says
      about the most wonderful vision that ever astonished human eyes, a miracle
      great enough to have stuffed credulity to bursting; and yet all we have is
      this one, poor, meagre verse. We know now that most of the last chapter of
      Mark is an interpolation, and as a matter of fact, the author of Mark's
      gospel said nothing about the ascension one way or the other.
    </p>
<p>
      Luke says: "And it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from
      them and was carried up into Heaven."
    </p>
<p>
      John does not mention it. He gives as Christ's last words this address to
      Peter: "Follow thou Me." Of course, he did not say that as he ascended. It
      seems to have made very little impression upon him; he writes the account
      as though tired of the story. He concludes with an impatient wave of the
      hand.
    </p>
<p>
      In the Acts we have another account. A conversation is given not spoken of
      in any of the others, and we find there two men clad in white apparel, who
      said: "Ye men of Galilee why stand ye here gazing up into heaven? This
      same Jesus that was taken up into heaven shall so come in like manner as
      ye have seen him go up into heaven."
    </p>
<p>
      Matthew did not see the men in white apparel, did not see the ascension.
      Mark forgot the entire transaction, and Luke did not think the men in
      white apparel worth mentioning. John had not confidence enough in the
      story to repeat it. And yet, upon such evidence, we are bound to believe
      in the bodily ascension, or suffer eternal pain.
    </p>
<p>
      And here let me ask, why was not the ascension in public?
    </p>
<p>
      Casting out Devils.
    </p>
<p>
      Most of the miracles said to have been wrought by Christ were recorded to
      show his power over evil spirits. On many occasions, he is said to have
      "cast out devils"—devils who could speak, and devils who were dumb.
    </p>
<p>
      For many years belief in the existence of evil spirits has been fading
      from the mind, and as this belief grew thin, ministers endeavored to give
      new meanings to the ancient words. They are inclined now to put "disease"
      in the place of "devils," and most of them say, that the poor wretches
      supposed to have been the homes of fiends, were simply suffering from
      epileptic fits! We must remember that Christ and these devils often
      conversed together. Is it possible that fits can talk? These devils often
      admitted that Christ was God. Can epilepsy certify to divinity? On one
      occasion the fits told their name, and made a contract to leave the body
      of a man provided they would be permitted to take possession of a herd of
      swine. Is it possible that fits carried Christ himself to the pinnacle of
      a temple? Did fits pretend to be the owner of the whole earth? Is Christ
      to be praised for resisting such a temptation? Is it conceivable that fits
      wanted Christ to fall down and worship them?
    </p>
<p>
      The church must not abandon its belief in devils. Orthodoxy cannot afford
      to put out the fires of hell. Throw away a belief in the devil, and most
      of the miracles of the New Testament become impossible, even if we admit
      the supernatural. If there is no devil, who was the original tempter in
      the garden of Eden? If there is no hell, from what are we saved; to what
      purpose is the atonement? Upon the obverse of the Christian shield is God,
      upon the reverse, the devil. No devil, no hell. No hell, no atonement. No
      atonement, no preaching, no gospel.
    </p>
<p>
      Necessity of Belief.
    </p>
<p>
      Does belief depend upon evidence? I think it does somewhat in some cases.
      How is it when a jury is sworn to try a case, hearing all the evidence,
      hearing both sides, hearing the charge of the judge, hearing the law, are
      upon their oaths equally divided, six for the plaintiff and six for the
      defendant? Evidence does not have the same effect upon all people. Why?
      Our brains are not alike. They are not the same shape. We have not the
      same intelligence, or the same experience, the same sense. And yet I am
      held accountable for my belief. I must believe in the Trinity—three
      times one is one, once one is three, and my soul is to be eternally damned
      for failing to guess an arithmetical conundrum. That is the poison part of
      Christianity—that salvation depends upon belief. That is the
      accursed part, and until that dogma is discarded Christianity will be
      nothing but superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      No man can control his belief. If I hear certain evidence I will believe a
      certain thing. If I fail to hear it I may never believe it. If it is
      adapted to my mind I may accept it; if it is not, I reject it. And what am
      I to go by? My brain. That is the only light I have from Nature, and if
      there be a God it is the only torch that this God has given me to find my
      way through the darkness and night called life. I do not depend upon
      hearsay for that. I do not have to take the word of any other man nor get
      upon my knees before a book. Here in the temple of the mind I consult the
      God, that is to say my reason, and the oracle speaks to me and I obey the
      oracle. What should I obey? Another man's oracle? Shall I take another
      man's word—not what he thinks, but what he says some God has said to
      him?
    </p>
<p>
      I would not know a god if I should see one. I have said before, and I say
      again, the brain thinks in spite of me, and I am not responsible for my
      thoughts. I cannot control the beating of my heart. I cannot stop the
      blood that flows through the rivers of my veins. And yet I am held
      responsible for my belief. Then why does not God give me the evidence?
      They say he has. In what? In an inspired book. But I do not understand it
      as they do. Must I be false to my understanding? They say: "When you come
      to die you will be sorry if you do not." Will I be sorry when I come to
      die that I did not live a hypocrite? Will I be sorry that I did not say I
      was a Christian when I was not? Will the fact that I was honest put a
      thorn in the pillow of death? Cannot God forgive me for being honest? They
      say that when he was in Jerusalem he forgave his murderers, but now he
      will not forgive an honest man for differing from him on the subject of
      the Trinity.
    </p>
<p>
      They say that God says to me, "Forgive your enemies." I say, "I do;" but
      he says, "I will damn mine." God should be consistent. If he wants me to
      forgive my enemies he should forgive his. I am asked to forgive enemies
      who can hurt me. God is only asked to forgive enemies who cannot hurt him.
      He certainly ought to be as generous as he asks us to be. And I want no
      God to forgive me unless I am willing to forgive others, and unless I do
      forgive others. All I ask, if that be true, is that this God should act
      according to his own doctrine. If I am to forgive my enemies, I ask him to
      forgive his. I do not believe in the religion of faith, but of kindness,
      of good deeds. The idea that man is responsible for his belief is at the
      bottom of religious intolerance and persecution.
    </p>
<p>
      How inconsistent these Christians are! In St. Louis the other day I read
      an interview with a Christian minister—one who is now holding a
      revival. They call him the boy preacher—a name that he has borne for
      fifty or sixty years. The question was whether in these revivals, when
      they were trying to rescue souls from eternal torture, they would allow
      colored people to occupy seats with white people; and that revivalist,
      preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ, said he would not allow the
      colored people to sit with white people; they must go to the back of the
      church. These same Christians tell us that in heaven there will be no
      distinction. That Christ cares nothing for the color of the skin. That in
      Paradise white and black will sit together, swap harps, and cry hallelujah
      in chorus; yet this minister, believing as he says he does, that all men
      who fail to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ will eternally perish, was
      not willing that a colored man should sit by a white man and hear the
      gospel of everlasting peace.
    </p>
<p>
      According to this revivalist, the ship of the world is going down; Christ
      is the only life-boat; and yet he is not willing that a colored man, with
      a soul to save, shall sit by the side of a white brother, and be rescued
      from eternal death. He admits that the white brother is totally depraved;
      that if the white brother had justice done him he would be damned; that it
      is only through the wonderful mercy of God that the white man is not in
      hell; and yet such a being, totally depraved, is too good to sit by a
      colored man! Total depravity becomes arrogant; total depravity draws the
      color line in religion, and an ambassador of Christ says to the black man,
      "Stand away; let your white brother hear first about the love of God."
    </p>
<p>
      I believe in the religion of humanity. It is far better to love our
      fellow-men than to love God. We can help them. We cannot help him. We had
      better do what we can than to be always pretending to do what we cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      Virtue is of no color; kindness, justice and love, of no complexion.
    </p>
<p>
      Eternal Punishment.
    </p>
<p>
      Now I come to the last part of this creed—the doctrine of eternal
      punishment. I have concluded that I will never deliver a lecture in which
      I will not attack the doctrine of eternal pain. That part of the
      Congregational creed would disgrace the lowest savage that crouches and
      crawls in the jungles of Africa. The man who now, in the nineteenth
      century, preaches the doctrine of eternal punishment, the doctrine of an
      eternal hell, has lived in vain. Think of that doctrine! The eternity of
      punishment! I find in this same creed—in this latest utterance of
      Congregationalism—that Christ is finally going to triumph in this
      world and establish his kingdom. This creed declares that "we believe in
      the ultimate prevalence of the kingdom of God over all the earth." If
      their doctrine is true he will never triumph in the other world. The
      Congregational Church does not believe in the ultimate prevalence of the
      kingdom of Christ in the world to come. There he is to meet with eternal
      failure. He will have billions in hell forever.
    </p>
<p>
      In this world we never will be perfectly civilized as long as a gallows
      casts its shadow upon the earth. As long as there is a penitentiary,
      within the walls of which a human being is immured, we are not a perfectly
      civilized people. We shall never be perfectly civilized until we do away
      with crime. And yet, according to this Christian religion, God is to have
      an eternal penitentiary; he is to be an everlasting jailer, an everlasting
      turnkey, a warden of an infinite dungeon, and he is going to keep
      prisoners there forever, not for the purpose of reforming them—because
      they are never going to get any better, only worse—but for the
      purpose of purposeless punishment. And for what? For something they failed
      to believe in this world. Born in ignorance, supported by poverty, caught
      in the snares of temptation, deformed by toil, stupefied by want—and
      yet held responsible through the countless ages of eternity! No man can
      think of a greater horror; no man can dream of a greater absurdity. For
      the growth of that doctrine ignorance was soil and fear was rain. It came
      from the fanged mouths of serpents, and yet it is called "glad tidings of
      great joy." Some Who are Damned.
    </p>
<p>
      We are told "God so loved the world" that he is going to damn almost
      everybody. If this orthodox religion be true, some of the greatest, and
      grandest, and best who ever lived are suffering God's torments to-night.
      It does not appear to make much difference with the members of the church.
      They go right on enjoying themselves about as well as ever. If this
      doctrine is true, Benjamin Franklin, one of the wisest and best of men,
      who did so much to give us here a free government, is suffering the
      tyranny of God to-night, although he endeavored to establish freedom among
      men. If the churches were honest, their preachers would tell their
      hearers: "Benjamin Franklin is in hell, and we warn all the youth not to
      imitate Benjamin Franklin. Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of
      Independence, with its self-evident truths, has been damned these many
      years."
    </p>
<p>
      That is what all the ministers ought to have the courage to say. Talk as
      you believe. Stand by your creed, or change it. I want to impress it upon
      your minds, because the thing I wish to do in this world is to put out the
      fires of hell. I will keep on as long as there is one little red coal left
      in the bottomless pit. As long as the ashes are warm I shall denounce this
      infamous doctrine.
    </p>
<p>
      I want you to know that according to this creed the men who founded this
      great and splendid Government are in hell to-night. Most of the men who
      fought in the Revolutionary war, and wrested from the clutch of Great
      Britain this continent, have been rewarded by the eternal wrath of God.
      Thousands of the old Revolutionary soldiers are in torment tonight. Let
      the preachers have the courage to say so. The men who fought in 1812, and
      gave to the United States the freedom of the seas, have nearly all been
      damned. Thousands of heroes who served our country in the Civil war,
      hundreds who starved in prisons, are now in the dungeons of God, compared
      with which, Andersonville was Paradise. The greatest of heroes are there;
      the greatest of poets, the greatest scientists, the men who have made the
      world beautiful—they are all among the damned if this creed is true.
    </p>
<p>
      Humboldt, who shed light, and who added to the intellectual wealth of
      mankind; Goethe, and Schiller, and Lessing, who almost created the German
      language—all gone—all suffering the wrath of God tonight, and
      every time an angel thinks of one of those men he gives his harp an extra
      twang. Laplace, who read the heavens like an open book—he is there.
      Robert Burns, the poet of human love—he is there. He wrote the
      "Prayer of Holy Willie." He fastened on the cross the Presbyterian creed,
      and there it is, a lingering crucifixion. Robert Burns increased the
      tenderness of the human heart. Dickens put a shield of pity before the
      flesh of childhood—God is getting even with him. Our own Ralph Waldo
      Emerson, although he had a thousand opportunities to hear Methodist
      clergymen, scorned the means of grace, lived to his highest ideal, gave to
      his fellow-men his best and truest thought, and yet his spirit is the
      sport and prey of fiends to-night.
    </p>
<p>
      Longfellow, who has refined thousands of homes, did not believe in the
      miraculous origin of the Savior, doubted the report of Gabriel, loved his
      fellow-men, did what he could to free the slaves, to increase the
      happiness of man, yet God was waiting for his soul—waiting to cast
      him out and down forever. Thomas Paine, author of the "Rights of Man;"
      offering his life in both hemispheres for the freedom of the human race;
      one of the founders of this Republic, is now among the damned; and yet it
      seems to me that if he could only get God's attention long enough to point
      him to the American flag he would let him out. Auguste Comte, author of
      the "Positive Philosophy," who loved his fellow-men to that degree that he
      made of humanity a god, who wrote his great work in poverty, with his face
      covered with tears—they are getting their revenge on him now.
    </p>
<p>
      Voltaire, who abolished torture in France; who did more for human liberty
      than any other man, living or dead; who was the assassin of superstition,
      and whose dagger still rusts in the heart of Catholicism—he is with
      the rest. All the priests who have been translated have had their
      happiness increased by looking at Voltaire.
    </p>
<p>
      Giordano Bruno, the first star of the morning after the long night;
      Benedict Spinoza, the pantheist, the metaphysician, the pure and generous
      man; Diderot, the encyclopedist, who endeavored to get all knowledge in a
      small compass, so that he could put the peasant on an equality
      intellectually with the prince; Diderot, who wished to sow all over the
      world the seed of knowledge, and loved to labor for mankind, while the
      priests wanted to burn; who did all he could to put out the fires—he
      was lost, long, long ago. His cry for water has become so common that his
      voice is now recognized through all the realms of heaven, and the angels
      laughing, say to one another, "That is Diderot."
    </p>
<p>
      David Hume, the Scotch philosopher, is there, with his inquiry about the
      "Human Understanding" and his argument against miracles. Beethoven, master
      of music, and Wagner, the Shakespeare of harmony, who made the air of this
      world rich forever, they are there; and to-night they have better music in
      hell than in heaven!
    </p>
<p>
      Shelley, whose soul, like his own "Skylark," was a winged joy, has been
      damned for many, many years; and Shakespeare, the greatest of the human
      race, who did more to elevate mankind than all the priests who ever lived
      and died, he is there; but founders of inquisitions, builders of dungeons,
      makers of chains, inventors of instruments of torture, tearers, and
      burners, and branders of human flesh, stealers of babes, and sellers of
      husbands and wives and children, and they who kept the horizon lurid with
      the fagot's flame for a thousand years—are in heaven to-night. I
      wish heaven joy!
    </p>
<p>
      That is the doctrine with which we are polluting the souls of children.
      That is the doctrine that puts a fiend by the dying bed and a prophecy of
      hell over every cradle. That is "glad tidings of great joy."
    </p>
<p>
      Only a little while ago, when the great flood came upon the Ohio, sent by
      him who is ruling the world and paying particular attention to the affairs
      of nations, just in the gray of the morning they saw a house floating down
      and on its top a human being. A few men went out to the rescue. They found
      there a woman, a mother, and they wished to save her life. She said: "No,
      I am going to stay where I am. In this house I have three dead babes; I
      will not desert them." Think of a love so limitless—stronger and
      deeper than despair and death! And yet, the Christian religion says, that
      if that woman, that mother, did not happen to believe in their creed God
      would send her soul to eternal fire! If there is another world, and if in
      heaven they wear hats, when such a woman climbs the opposite bank of the
      Jordan, Christ should lift his to her.
    </p>
<p>
      The doctrine of eternal pain is my trouble with this Christian religion. I
      reject it on account of its infinite heartlessness. I cannot tell them too
      often, that during our last war Christians, who knew that if they were
      shot they would go right to heaven, went and hired wicked men to take
      their places, perfectly willing that these men should go to hell provided
      they could stay at home. You see they are not honest in it, or they do not
      believe it, or as the people say, "they don't sense it." They have not
      imagination enough to conceive what it is they believe, and what a
      terrific falsehood they assert. And I beg of every one who hears me
      to-night, I beg, I implore, I beseech you, never to give another dollar to
      build a church in which that lie is preached. Never give another cent to
      send a missionary with his mouth stuffed with that falsehood to a foreign
      land. Why, they say, the heathen will go to heaven, any way, if you let
      them alone. What is the use of sending them to hell by enlightening them?
      Let them alone. The idea of going and telling a man a thing that if he
      does not believe, he will be damned, when the chances are ten to one that
      he will not believe it, is monstrous. Do not tell him here, and as quick
      as he gets to the other world and finds it is necessary to believe, he can
      say "Yes." Give him a chance.
    </p>
<p>
      Another Objection.
    </p>
<p>
      My objection to orthodox religion is that it destroys human love, and
      tells us that the love of this world is not necessary to make a heaven in
      the next.
    </p>
<p>
      No matter about your wife, your children, your brother, your sister—no
      matter about all the affections of the human heart—when you get
      there, you will be with the angels. I do not know whether I would like the
      angels. I do not know whether the angels would like me. I would rather
      stand by the ones who have loved me and whom I know; and I can conceive of
      no heaven without the loved of this earth. That is the trouble with this
      Christian relief-ion. Leave your father, leave your mother, leave your
      wife, leave your children, leave everything and follow Jesus Christ. I
      will not. I will stay with my people. I will not sacrifice on the altar of
      a selfish fear all the grandest and noblest promptings of my heart.
    </p>
<p>
      Do away with human love and what are we? What would we be in another
      world, and what would we be here? Can any one conceive of music without
      human love? Of art, or joy? Human love builds every home. Human love is
      the author of all beauty. Love paints every picture, and chisels every
      statue. Love builds every fireside. What could heaven be without human
      love? And yet that is what we are promised—a heaven with your wife
      lost, your mother lost, some of your children gone. And you expect to be
      made happy by falling in with some angel! Such a religion is infamous.
      Christianity holds human love for naught; and yet Love is the only bow on
      Life's dark cloud. It is the morning and the evening star. It shines upon
      the babe, and sheds its radiance on the quiet tomb. It is the mother of
      art, inspirer of poet, patriot and philosopher. It is the air and light of
      every heart—builder of every home, kindler of every fire on every
      hearth. It was the first to dream of immortality. It fills the world with
      melody—for music is the voice of love. Love is the magician, the
      enchanter, that changes worthless things to joy, and makes right royal
      kings and queens of common clay. It is the perfume of that wondrous
      flower, the heart, and without that sacred passion, that divine swoon, we
      are less than beasts; but with it, earth is heaven, and we are gods.
    </p>
<p>
      And how are you to get to this heaven? On the efforts of another. You are
      to be a perpetual heavenly pauper, and you will have to admit through all
      eternity that you never would have been there if you had not been
      frightened. "I am here," you will say, "I have these wings, I have this
      musical instrument, because I was scared. I am here. The ones who loved me
      are among the damned; the ones I loved are also there—but I am here,
      that is enough."
    </p>
<p>
      What a glorious' world heaven must be! No reformation in that world—not
      the slightest. If you die in Arkansas that is the end of you! Think of
      telling a boy in the next world, who lived and died in Delaware, that he
      had been fairly treated! Can anything be more infamous?
    </p>
<p>
      All on an equality—the rich and the poor, those with parents loving
      them, those with every opportunity for education, on an equality with the
      poor, the abject and the ignorant—and this little day called life,
      this moment with a hope, a shadow and a tear, this little space between
      your mother's arms and the grave, balances eternity.
    </p>
<p>
      God can do nothing for you when you get there. A Methodist preacher can do
      more for the soul here than its creator can there. The soul goes to
      heaven, where there is nothing but good society; no bad examples; and they
      are all there, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and yet they can do nothing for
      that poor unfortunate except to damn him. Is there any sense in that?
    </p>
<p>
      Why should this be a period of probation? It says in the Bible, I believe,
      "Now is the accepted time." When does that mean? That means whenever the
      passage is pronounced. "Now is the accepted time." It will be the same
      to-morrow, will it not? And just as appropriate then as to-day, and if
      appropriate at any time, appropriate through all eternity.
    </p>
<p>
      What I say is this: There is no world—there can be no world—in
      which every human being will not have the eternal opportunity of doing
      right.
    </p>
<p>
      That is my objection to this Christian religion; and if the love of earth
      is not the love of heaven, if those we love here are to be separated from
      us there, then I want eternal sleep. Give me a good cool grave rather than
      the furnace of Jehovah's wrath. I pray the angel of the resurrection to
      let me sleep. Gabriel, do not blow! Let me alone! If, when the grave
      bursts, I am not to meet the faces that have been my sunshine in this
      life, let me sleep. Rather than that this doctrine of endless punishment
      should be true, I would gladly see the fabric of our civilization
      crumbling fall to unmeaning chaos and to formless dust, where oblivion
      broods and even memory forgets. I would rather that the blind Samson of
      some imprisoned force, released by chance, should so wreck and strand the
      mighty world that man in stress and strain of want and fear should
      shudderingly crawl back to savage and barbaric night. I would rather that
      every planet should in its orbit wheel a barren star!
    </p>
<p>
      What I Believe.
    </p>
<p>
      I think it is better to love your children than to love God, a thousand
      times better, because you can help them, and I am inclined to think that
      God can get along without you. Certainly we cannot help a being without
      body, parts, or passions!
    </p>
<p>
      I believe in the religion of the family. I believe that the roof-tree is
      sacred, from the smallest fibre that feels the soft cool clasp of earth,
      to the topmost flower that spreads its bosom to the sun, and like a
      spendthrift gives its perfume to the air. The home where virtue dwells
      with love is like a lily with a heart of fire—the fairest flower in
      all the world. And I tell you God cannot afford to damn a man in the next
      world who has made a happy family in this. God cannot afford to cast over
      the battlements of heaven the man who has a happy home upon this earth.
      God cannot afford to be unpitying to a human heart capable of pity. God
      cannot clothe with fire the man who has clothed the naked here; and God
      cannot send to eternal pain a man who has done something toward improving
      the condition of his fellow-man. If he can, I had rather go to hell than
      to heaven and keep the company of such a god.
    </p>
<p>
      Immortality.
    </p>
<p>
      They tell me that the next terrible thing I do is to take away the hope of
      immortality! I do not, I would not, I could not. Immortality was first
      dreamed of by human love; and yet the church is going to take human love
      out of immortality. We love, therefore we wish to live. A loved one dies
      and we wish to meet again; and from the affection of the human heart grew
      the great oak of the hope of immortality. Around that oak has climbed the
      poisonous vines of superstition. Theologians, pretenders, soothsayers,
      parsons, priests, popes, bishops, have taken advantage of that. They have
      stood by graves and promised heaven. They have stood by graves and
      prophesied a future filled with pain. They have erected their toll-gates
      on the highway of life and have collected money from fear.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither the Bible nor the church gave us the idea of immortality. The Old
      Testament tells us how we lost immortality, and it does not say a word
      about another world, from the first mistake in Genesis to the last curse
      in Malachi. There is not in the Old Testament a burial service.
    </p>
<p>
      No man in the Old Testament stands by the dead and says, "We shall meet
      again." From the top of Sinai came no hope of another world.
    </p>
<p>
      And when we get to the New Testament, what do we find? "They that are
      accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection of the dead."
      As though some would be counted unworthy to obtain the resurrection of the
      dead. And in another place. "Seek for honor, glory, immortality." If you
      have it, why seek it? And in another place, "God, who alone hath
      immortality." Yet they tell us that we get our idea of immortality from
      the Bible. I deny it.
    </p>
<p>
      I would not destroy the faintest ray of human hope, but I deny that we got
      our idea of immortality from the Bible. It existed long before Moses. We
      find it symbolized through all Egypt, through all India. Wherever man has
      lived he has made another world in which to meet the lost of this.
    </p>
<p>
      The history of this belief we find in tombs and temples wrought and carved
      by those who wept and hoped. Above their dead they laid the symbols of
      another life.
    </p>
<p>
      We do not know. We do not prophesy a life of pain. We leave the dead with
      Nature, the mother of us all. Under the bow of hope, under the seven-hued
      arch, let the dead sleep.
    </p>
<p>
      If Christ was in fact God, why did he not plainly say there is another
      life? Why did he not tell us something about it? Why did he not turn the
      tear-stained hope of immortality into the glad knowledge of another life?
      Why did he go dumbly to his death and leave the world in darkness and in
      doubt? Why? Because he was a man and did not know.
    </p>
<p>
      What consolation has the orthodox religion for the widow of the
      unbeliever, the widow of a good, brave, kind man? What can the orthodox
      minister say to relieve the bursting heart of that woman? What can he say
      to relieve the aching hearts of the orphans as they kneel by the grave of
      that father, if that father did not happen to be an orthodox Christian?
      What consolation have they? When a Christian loses a friend the tears
      spring from his eyes as quickly as from the eyes of others. Their tears
      are as bitter as ours. Why? The echoes of the words spoken eighteen
      hundred years ago are so low, and the sounds of the clods upon the coffin
      are so loud; the promises are so far away, and the dead are so near.
    </p>
<p>
      We do not know, we cannot say, whether death is a wall or a door; the
      beginning or end of a day; the spreading of pinions to soar, or the
      folding forever of wings; the rise or the set of a sun, or an endless life
      that brings the rapture of love to everyone. A Fable.
    </p>
<p>
      There is the fable of Orpheus and Eurydice. Eurydice had been captured and
      taken to the infernal regions, and Orpheus went after her, taking with him
      his harp and playing as he went. When he came to Pluto's realm he began to
      play, and Sysiphus, charmed by the music, sat down upon the stone that he
      had been heaving up the mountain's side for so many years, and which
      continually rolled back upon him; Ixion paused upon his wheel of fire;
      Tantalus ceased his vain efforts for water; the daughters of the Danaides
      left off trying to fill their sieves with water; Pluto smiled, and for the
      first time in the history of hell the cheeks of the Furies were wet with
      tears. The god relented, and said, "Eurydice may go with you, but you must
      not look back." So Orpheus again threaded the caverns, playing as he went,
      and as he reached the light he failed to hear the footsteps of Eurydice.
      He looked back, and in a moment she was gone. Again and again Orpheus
      sought his love. Again and again looked back.
    </p>
<p>
      This fable gives the idea of the perpetual effort made by the human mind
      to rescue truth from the clutch of error.
    </p>
<p>
      Some time Orpheus will not look back. Some day Eurydice will reach the
      blessed light, and at last there will fade from the memory of men the
      monsters of superstition.

<h2>
      MYTH AND MIRACLE.
    </h2>
<h3>
      I.
    </h3>
<p>
      HAPPINESS is the true end and aim of life. It is the task of intelligence
      to ascertain the conditions of happiness, and when found the truly wise
      will live in accordance with them. By happiness is meant not simply the
      joy of eating and drinking—the gratification of the appetite—but
      good, wellbeing, in the highest and noblest forms. The joy that springs
      from obligation discharged, from duty done, from generous acts, from being
      true to the ideal, from a perception of the beautiful in nature, art and
      conduct. The happiness that is born of and gives birth to poetry and
      music, that follows the gratification of the highest wants.
    </p>
<p>
      Happiness is the result of all that is really right and sane.
    </p>
<p>
      But there are many people who regard the desire to be happy as a very low
      and degrading ambition. These people call themselves spiritual. They
      pretend to care nothing for the pleasures of "sense." They hold this
      world, this life, in contempt. They do not want happiness in this world—but
      in another. Here, happiness degrades—there, it purifies and
      ennobles.
    </p>
<p>
      These spiritual people have been known as prophets, apostles, augurs,
      hermits, monks, priests, popes, bishops and parsons. They are devout and
      useless. They do not cultivate the soil. They produce nothing. They live
      on the labor of others. They are pious and parasitic. They pray for
      others, if the others will work for them. They claim to have been selected
      by the Infinite to instruct and govern mankind. They are "meek" and
      arrogant, "long-suffering" and revengeful.
    </p>
<p>
      They ever have been, now are, and always will be the enemies of liberty,
      of investigation and science. They are believers in the supernatural, the
      miraculous and the absurd. They have filled the world with hatred, bigotry
      and fear. In defence of their creeds they have committed every crime and
      practiced every cruelty.
    </p>
<p>
      They denounce as worldly and sensual those who are gross enough to love
      wives and children, to build homes, to fell the forests, to navigate the
      seas, to cultivate the earth, to chisel statues, to paint pictures and
      fill the world with love and art.
    </p>
<p>
      They have denounced and maligned the thinkers, the poets, the dramatists,
      the composers, the actors, the orators, the workers—those who have
      conquered the world for man.
    </p>
<p>
      According to them this world is only the vestibule of the next, a kind of
      school, an ordeal, a place of probation. They have always insisted that
      this life should be spent in preparing for the next; that those who
      supported and obeyed the "spiritual guides"—the shepherds, would be
      rewarded with an eternity of joy, and that all others would suffer eternal
      pain.
    </p>
<p>
      These spiritual people have always hated labor. They have added nothing to
      the wealth of the world. They have always lived on alms—on the labor
      of others. They have always been the enemies of innocent pleasure, and of
      human love.
    </p>
<p>
      These spiritual people have produced a literature. The books they have
      written are called sacred. Our sacred books are called the Bible. The
      Hindoos have the Vedas and many others, the Persians the Zend Avesta—the
      Egyptians had the Book of the Dead—the Aztecs the Popol Vuh, and the
      Mohammedans have the Koran.
    </p>
<p>
      These books, for the most part, treat of the unknowable. They describe
      gods and winged phantoms of the air. They give accounts of the origin of
      the universe, the creation of man and the worlds beyond this. They contain
      nothing of value. Millions and millions of people have wasted their lives
      studying these absurd and ignorant books.
    </p>
<p>
      The "spiritual people" in each country claimed that their books had been
      written by inspired men—that God was the real author, and that all
      men and women who denied this would be, after death, tormented forever.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, the worldly people, the uninspired, the wicked, have produced a
      far greater literature than the spiritual and the inspired.
    </p>
<p>
      Not all the sacred books of the world equal Shakespeare's "volume of the
      brain." A purer philosophy, grander, nobler, fell from the lips of
      Shakespeare's clowns than the Old Testament, or the New, contains.
    </p>
<p>
      The Declaration of Independence is nobler far than all the utterances from
      Sinai's cloud and flame. "A Man's a Man for a' That," by Robert Burns, is
      better than anything the sacred books contain. For my part, I would rather
      hear Beethoven's Sixth Symphony than to read the five books of Moses. Give
      me the Sixth Symphony—this sound-wrought picture of the fields and
      woods, of flowering hedge and happy home, where thrushes build and
      swallows fly, and mothers sing to babes; this echo of the babbled lullaby
      of brooks that, dallying, wind and fall where meadows bare their daisied
      bosoms to the sun; this joyous mimicry of summer rain, the laugh of
      children, and the rhythmic rustle of the whispering leaves; this strophe
      of peasant life; this perfect poem of content and love.
    </p>
<p>
      I would rather listen to Tristan and Isolde—that Mississippi of
      melody—where the great notes, winged like eagles, lift the soul
      above the cares and griefs of this weary world—than to all the
      orthodox sermons ever preached. I would rather look at the Venus de Milo
      than to read the Presbyterian creed.
    </p>
<p>
      The spiritual have endeavored to civilize the world through fear and faith—by
      the promise of reward and the threat of pain in other worlds. They taught
      men to hate and persecute their fellow-men. In all ages they have appealed
      to force. During all the years they have practiced fraud. They have
      pretended to have influence with the gods—that their prayers gave
      rain, sunshine and harvest—that their curses brought pestilence and
      famine, and that their blessings filled the world with plenty. They have
      subsisted on the fears their falsehoods created. Like poisonous vines,
      they have lived on the oak of labor. They have praised charity, but they
      never gave. They have denounced revenge, but they never forgave.
    </p>
<p>
      Whenever the spiritual have had power, art has died, learning has
      languished, science has been despised, liberty destroyed, the thinkers
      have been imprisoned, the intelligent and honest have been outcasts, and
      the brave have been murdered.
    </p>
<p>
      The "spiritual" have been, are, and always will be the enemies of the
      human race.
    </p>
<p>
      For all the blessings that we now enjoy—for progress in every form,
      for science and art—for all that has lengthened life, that has
      conquered disease, that has lessened pain, for raiment, roof and food, for
      music in its highest forms—for the poetry that has ennobled and
      enriched our lives—for the marvellous machines now working for the
      world—for all this we are indebted to the worldly—to those who
      turned their attention to the affairs of this life. They have been the
      only benefactors of our race.
    </p>
<p>
      II.
    </p>
<p>
      AND yet all of these religions—these "sacred books," these priests,
      have been naturally produced. From the dens and caves of savagery to the
      palaces of civilization men have traveled by the necessary paths and
      roads. Back of every step has been the efficient cause. In the history of
      the world there has been no chance, no interference from without, nothing
      miraculous. Everything in accordance with and produced by the facts in
      nature.
    </p>
<p>
      We need not blame the hypocritical and cruel. They thought and acted as
      they were compelled to think and act.
    </p>
<p>
      In all ages man has tried to account for himself and his surroundings. He
      did the best he could. He wondered why the water ran, why the trees grew,
      why the clouds floated, why the stars shone, why the sun and moon
      journeyed through the heavens. He was troubled about life and death, about
      darkness and dreams. The seas, the volcanoes, the lightning and thunder,
      the earthquake and cyclone, filled him with fear. Behind all life and
      growth and motion, and even inanimate things, he placed a spirit—an
      intelligent being—a fetich, a person, something like himself—a
      god, controlled by love and hate. To him causes and effects became gods—supernatural
      beings. The Dawn was a maiden, wondrously fair, the Sun, a warrior and
      lover; the Night, a serpent, a wolf—the Wind, a musician; Winter, a
      wild beast; Autumn, Proserpine gathering flowers.
    </p>
<p>
      Poets were the makers of these myths. They were the first to account for
      what they saw and felt. The great multitude mistook these fancies for
      facts. Myths strangely alike, were produced by most nations, and gradually
      took possession of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      The Sleeping Beauty, a myth of the year, has been found among most
      peoples. In this myth, the Earth was a maiden—the Sun was her lover,
      She had fallen asleep in winter. Her blood was still and her breath had
      gone. In the Spring the lover came, clasped her in his arms, covered her
      lips and cheeks with kisses. She was thrilled, her heart began to beat,
      she breathed, her blood flowed, and she awoke to love and joy. This myth
      has made the circuit of the globe.
    </p>
<p>
      So, Red Riding-Hood is the history of a day. Little Red Riding-Hood—the
      morning, touched with red, goes to visit her kindred, a day that is past.
      She is attacked by the wolf of night and is rescued by the hunter, Apollo,
      who pierces the heart of the beast with an arrow of light.
    </p>
<p>
      The beautiful myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is the story of the year.
      Eurydice has been captured and carried to the infernal world. Orpheus,
      playing upon his harp, goes after her. Such is the effect of his music
      when he reaches the realm of Pluto, the laughterless, that Tantalus ceases
      his efforts to slake his thirst. He listens and forgets his withered lips,
      the daughters of the Danaides cease their vain efforts to fill the sieve
      with water, Sisyphus sits down on the stone that he so often had heaved
      against the mountain's misty side, Ixion pauses upon his wheel of fire,
      even Pluto smiles, and for the first time in the history of hell the
      cheeks of the Furies are wet with tears.
    </p>
<p>
      "Give me back Eurydice," cried Orpheus, and Pluto said: "Take her, but
      look not back." Orpheus led the way and Eurydice followed. Just as he
      reached the upper world, he missed her footsteps, turned, looked, and she
      vanished.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus the summer comes, is lost, and comes again through all the years.
    </p>
<p>
      So, our ancestors believed in the Garden of Eden, in the Golden Age, in
      the blessed time when all were good and pure—when nature satisfied
      the wants of all. The race, like the old man, has golden dreams of youth.
      The morning was filled with light and life and joy, and the evening is
      always sad. When the old man was young, girls were beautiful and men were
      honest. He remembers his Eden. And so the whole world has had its age of
      gold.
    </p>
<p>
      Our fathers were believers in the Elysian Fields. They were in the far,
      far West. They saw them at the setting of the sun. They saw the floating
      isles of gold in sapphire seas; the templed mist with spires and domes of
      emerald and amethyst; the magic caverns of the clouds, resplendent with
      the rays of every gem. And as they looked, they thought the curtain had
      been drawn aside and that their eyes had for a moment feasted on the
      glories of another world.
    </p>
<p>
      The myth of the Flood has also been universal. Finding shells of the seas
      on plain and mountain, and everywhere some traces of the waves, they
      thought the world had been submerged—that God in wrath had drowned
      the race, except a few his mercy saved.
    </p>
<p>
      The Hindus say that Menu, a holy man, dipped from the Ganges some water,
      and in the basin saw a little fish. The fish begged him to throw him back
      into the river, and Menu, having pity, cast him back. The fish then told
      Menu that there was to be a flood—told him to build an ark, to take
      on board, people, animals and food, and that when the flood came, he, the
      fish, would save him. The saint did as he was told, the flood came, the
      fish returned. By that time he had grown to be a whale with a horn in his
      head. About this horn Menu fastened a rope, attached the other end to the
      ark, and the fish towed the boat across the raging waves to a mountain's
      top, where it rested until the waters subsided. The name of this wonderful
      fish was Matsaya.
    </p>
<p>
      Many other nations told similar stories of floods and arks and the sending
      forth of doves.
    </p>
<p>
      In all these myths and legends of the past we find philosophies and dreams
      and efforts, stained with tears, of great and tender souls who tried to
      pierce the mysteries of life and death, to answer the questions of the
      whence and whither, and who vainly sought with bits of shattered glass to
      make a mirror that would in very truth reflect the face and form of
      Nature's perfect self. These myths were born of hopes and fears, of tears
      and smiles, and they were touched and colored by all there is of joy and
      grief between the rosy dawn of birth and death's sad night. They clothed
      even the stars with passion, and gave to gods the faults and frailties of
      the sons of men. In them the winds and waves were music, and all the
      springs, the mountains, woods and perfumed dells were haunted by a
      thousand fairy forms. They thrilled the veins of Spring with tremulous
      desire, made tawny Summer's billowy breast the throne and home of love,
      filled Autumn's arms with sun-kissed grapes and gathered sheaves, and
      pictured Winter as a weak old king, who felt, like Lear, upon his withered
      face, Cordelia's tears.
    </p>
<p>
      These myths, though false in fact, are beautiful and true in thought, and
      have for many ages and in countless ways enriched the heart and kindled
      thought.
    </p>
<p>
      III.
    </p>
<p>
      IN all probability the first religion was Sun-worship. Nothing could have
      been more natural. Light was life and warmth and love. The sun was the
      fireside of the world. The sun was the "all-seeing"—the "Sky
      Father." Darkness was grief and death, and in the shadows crawled the
      serpents of despair and fear.
    </p>
<p>
      The sun was a great warrior, fighting the hosts of Night. Apollo was the
      sun, and he fought and conquered the serpent of Night. Agni, the generous,
      who loved the lowliest and visited the humblest, was the sun. He was the
      god of fire, and the crossed sticks that by friction leaped into flame
      were his emblem. It was said that, in spite of his goodness, he devoured
      his father and mother, the two pieces of wood being his parents. Baldur
      was the sun. He was in love with the Dawn—a maiden—he deserted
      her and traveled through the heavens alone. At the twilight they met, were
      reconciled, and the drops of dew were the tears of joy they shed.
    </p>
<p>
      Chrishna was the sun. At his birth the Ganges thrilled from its source to
      the sea. All the trees, the dead as well as the living, burst into leaf
      and bud and flower.
    </p>
<p>
      Hercules was a sun-god.
    </p>
<p>
      Jonah the same, rescued from the fiends of Night and carried by the fish
      through the under world. Samson was a sun-god. His strength was in his
      hair—in his beams. He was shorn of his strength by Delilah, the
      shadow—the darkness. So, Osiris, Bacchus, Mithra, Hermes, Buddha,
      Quelzalcoatle, Prometheus, Zoroaster, Perseus, Codom Lao-tsze Fo-hi, Horus
      and Rameses were all sun-gods.
    </p>
<p>
      All these gods had gods for fathers and all their mothers were virgins.
    </p>
<p>
      The births of nearly all were announced by stars.
    </p>
<p>
      When they were born there was celestial music—voices declared that a
      blessing had come upon the earth.
    </p>
<p>
      When Buddha was born, the celestial choir sang: "This day is born for the
      good of men Buddha, and to dispel the darkness of their ignorance—to
      give joy and peace to the world."
    </p>
<p>
      Chrishna was born in a cave, and protected by shepherds. Bacchus, Apollo,
      Mithra and Hermes were all born in caves. Buddha was born in an inn—according
      to some, under a tree.
    </p>
<p>
      Tyrants sought to kill all of these gods when they were babes.
    </p>
<p>
      When Chrishna was born, a tyrant killed the babes of the neighborhood.

      Buddha was the child of Maya, a virgin, in the kingdom of Madura. The king
      arrested Maya before the child was born, imprisoned her in a tower. During
      the night when the child was born, a great wind wrecked the tower, and
      carried mother and child to a place of safety. The next morning the king
      sent his soldiers to kill the babes, and when they came to Buddha and his
      mother, the babe appeared to be about twelve years of age, and the
      soldiers passed on.
    </p>
<p>
      So Typhon sought in many ways to destroy the babe Horus. The king pursued
      the infant Zoroaster. Cadmus tried to kill the infant Bacchus.
    </p>
<p>
      All of these gods were born on the 25th of December.
    </p>
<p>
      Nearly all were worshiped by "wise men."
    </p>
<p>
      All of them fasted for forty days.
    </p>
<p>
      All met with a violent death.
    </p>
<p>
      All rose from the dead.
    </p>
<p>
      The history of these gods is the history of our Christ. He had a god for a
      father, a virgin for a mother. He was born in a manger, or a cave—on
      the 2 5th of December. His birth was announced by angels. He was worshiped
      by wise men, guided by a star. Herod, seeking his life, caused the death
      of many babes. Christ fasted for forty days. So, it rained for forty days
      before the flood—Moses was on Mt. Sinai for forty days. The temple
      had forty pillars and the Jews wandered in the wilderness for forty years.
      Christ met with a violent death, and rose from the dead.
    </p>
<p>
      These things are not accidents—not coincidences. Christ was a
      sun-god. All religions have been born of sun-worship. To-day, when priests
      pray, they shut their eyes. This is a survival of sun-worship. When men
      worshiped the sun, they had to shut their eyes. Afterwards, to flatter
      idols, they pretended that the glory of their faces was more than the eyes
      could bear.
    </p>
<p>
      In the religion of our day there is nothing original. All of its
      doctrines, its symbols and ceremonies are but the survivals of creeds that
      perished long ago. Baptism is far older than Christianity—than
      Judaism. The Hindus, the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had holy water.
      The eucharist was borrowed from the Pagans. Ceres was the goddess of the
      fields, Bacchus the god of the vine. At the harvest festival they made
      cakes of wheat and said: "These are the flesh of the goddess." They drank
      wine and cried: "This is the blood of our god."
    </p>
<p>
      The cross has been a symbol for many thousands of years. It was a symbol
      of immortality—of life, of the god Agni, the form of the grave of a
      man. An ancient people of Italy, who lived long before the Romans, long
      before the Etruscans, so long that not one word of their language is
      known, used the cross, and beneath that emblem, carved on stone, their
      dead still rest. In the forests of Central America, ruined temples have
      been found, and on the walls the cross with the bleeding victim. On
      Babylonian cylinders is the impression of the cross. The Trinity came from
      Egypt. Osiris, Isis and Horus were worshiped thousands of years before our
      Father, Son and Holy Ghost were thought of. So the Tree of Life grew in
      India, China and among the Aztecs long before the Garden of Eden was
      planted. Long before our Bible was known, other nations had their sacred
      books, temples and altars, sacrifices, ceremonies and priests. The "Fall
      of Man" is far older than our religion, and so are the "Atonement" and the
      Scheme of Redemption.
    </p>
<p>
      In our blessed religion there is nothing new, nothing original.
    </p>
<p>
      Among the Egyptians the cross was a symbol of the life to come. And yet
      the first religion was, and all religions growing out of that, were
      naturally produced. Every brain was a field in which Nature sowed the
      seeds of thought. The rise and set of sun, the birth and death of day, the
      dawns of silver and the dusks of gold, the wonders of the rain and snow,
      the shroud of Winter and the many colored robe of Spring, the lonely moon
      with nightly loss or gain, the serpent lightning and the thunder's voice,
      the tempest's fury and the zephyr's sigh, the threat of storm and promise
      of the bow, cathedral clouds with dome and spire, earthquake and strange
      eclipse, frost and fire, the snow-crowned mountains with their tongues of
      flame, the fields of space sown thick with stars, the wandering comets
      hurrying past the fixed and sleepless sentinels of night, the marvels of
      the earth and air, the perfumed flower, the painted wing, the waveless
      pool that held within its magic breast the image of the startled face, the
      mimic echo that made a record in the viewless air, the pathless forests
      and the boundless seas, the ebb and flow of tides—the slow, deep
      breathing of some vague and monstrous life—the miracle of birth, the
      mystery of dream and death, and over all the silent and immeasurable dome.
      These were the warp and woof, and at the loom sat Love and Fancy, Hope and
      Fear, and wove the wondrous tapestries whereon we find pictures of gods
      and fairy lands and all the legends that were told when Nature rocked the
      cradle of the infant world.

      IV.
    </p>
<p>
      WE must remember that there is a great difference. Myth is the
      idealization of a fact. A miracle is the counterfeit of a fact. There is
      the same difference between a myth and a miracle that there is between
      fiction and falsehood—between poetry and perjury. Miracles belong to
      the far past and the far future. The little line of sand, called the
      present, between the seas, belongs to common sense, to the natural.
    </p>
<p>
      If you should tell a man that the dead were raised two thousand years ago,
      he would probably say: "Yes, I know that." If you should say that a
      hundred thousand years from now all the dead will be raised, he might say:
      "Probably they will." But if you should tell him that you saw a dead man
      raised and given life that day, he would likely ask the name of the insane
      asylum from which you had escaped.
    </p>
<p>
      Our Bible is filled with accounts of miracles and yet they always fail to
      convince.
    </p>
<p>
      Jehovah, according to the Scriptures, wrought hundreds of miracles for the
      benefit of the Jews. With many miracles he rescued them from slavery,
      guided them on their journey with a miraculous cloud by day and a
      miraculous pillar of fire by night—divided the sea that they might
      escape from the Egyptians, fed them with miraculous manna and supernatural
      quails, raised up hornets to attack their enemies, caused water to follow
      them wherever they wandered and in countless ways manifested his power,
      and yet the Jews cared nothing for these wonders. Not one of them seems to
      have been convinced that Jehovah had done anything for the people.
    </p>
<p>
      In spite of all these miracles, the Jews had more confidence in a golden
      calf, made by themselves, than in Jehovah. The reason of this is, that the
      miracles were never performed, and never invented until hundreds of years
      after those, who had wandered over the desert of Sinai, were dust.
    </p>
<p>
      The miracles attributed to Christ had no effect. No human being seems to
      have been convinced by them. Those whom he raised from the dead, cured of
      leprosy, or blindness, failed to become his followers. Not one of them
      appeared at his trial. Not one offered to bear witness of his miraculous
      power.
    </p>
<p>
      To this there is but one explanation: The miracles were never performed.
      These stories were the growth of centuries. The casting out of devils, the
      changing of water into wine, feeding the multitude with a few loaves and
      fishes, resisting the devil, using a fish for a pocketbook, curing the
      blind with clay and saliva, stilling the tempest, walking on the water,
      the resurrection and ascension, happened and only happened, in the
      imaginations of men, who were not born until several generations after
      Christ was dead.
    </p>
<p>
      In those days the world was filled with ignorance and fear. Miracles
      happened every day. The supernatural was expected. Gods were continually
      interfering with the affairs of this world. Everything was told except the
      truth, everything believed except the facts. History was a circumstantial
      account of occurrences that never occurred. Devils and goblins and ghosts
      were as plentiful as saints. The bones of the dead were used to cure the
      living. Cemeteries were hospitals and corpses were physicians. The saints
      practiced magic, the pious communed with God in dreams, and the course of
      events was changed by prayer. The credulous demanded the marvelous, the
      miraculous, and the priests supplied the demand. The sky was full of
      signs, omens of death and disaster, and the darkness thick with devils
      endeavoring to mislead and enslave the souls of men.
    </p>
<p>
      Our fathers thought that everything had been made for man, and that demons
      and gods gave their entire attention to this world. The people believed
      that they were the sport and prey, the favorites or victims, of these
      phantoms. And they also believed that the Creator, the God, could be
      influenced by sacrifice, by prayers and ceremonies.
    </p>
<p>
      This has been the mistake of the world. All the temples have been reared,
      all the altars erected, all the sacrifices offered, all the prayers
      uttered in vain. No god has interfered, no prayer has been answered, no
      help received from heaven. Nothing was created, nothing has happened for,
      or with reference to man. If not a human being lived,—if all Were
      in' their graves, the sun would continue to shine, the wheeling world
      would still pursue its flight, violets would spread their velvet bosoms to
      the day, the spendthrift roses give their perfume to the air, the climbing
      vines would hide with leaf and flower the fallen and the dead, the
      changing seasons would come-and go,-time would repeat the poem of the
      year, storms would wreck and whispering rains repair, Spring with deft and
      unseen hands would weave her robes of green, life with countless lips
      would seek fair Summer's swelling breasts, Autumn would reap the wealth of
      leaf and fruit and seed, Winter, the artist, would etch in frost the pines
      and ferns, while Wind and Wave and Fire, old architects, with ceaseless
      toil would still destroy and build, still wreck and change, and from the
      dust of death produce again the throb and breath of life.
    </p>
<p>
      V.
    </p>
<p>
      A FEW years ago a few men began to think, to investigate, to reason. They
      began to doubt the legends of the church, the miracles of the past. They
      began to notice what happened. They found that eclipses came at certain
      intervals and that their coming could be foretold. They became satisfied
      that the conduct of men had nothing to do with eclipses—and that the
      stars moved in their orbits unconscious of the sons of men. Galileo,
      Copernicus, and Kepler' destroyed the astronomy of the Bible, and
      demonstrated that the "inspired" story of creation could not be true, and
      that the church was as ignorant as the priests were dishonest.
    </p>
<p>
      They found that the myth-makers were mistaken, that the sun and stars did
      not revolve about the earth, that the firmament was not solid, that the
      earth was not flat, and that the so-called philosophy of the theologians
      was absurd and idiotic.
    </p>
<p>
      The stars became witnesses against the creeds of superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      With the telescope the heavens were explored. The New Jerusalem could not
      be found.
    </p>
<p>
      It had faded away.
    </p>
<p>
      The church persecuted the astronomers and denied the facts. In February,
      in the year of grace sixteen hundred, the Catholic Church, the "Triumphant
      Beast," having in her hands, her paws, the keys of heaven and hell,
      accused Giordano Bruno of having declared that there were other worlds
      than this. He was tried, convicted, imprisoned in a dungeon for seven
      years. He was offered his liberty if he would recant. Bruno, the atheist,
      the philosopher, refused to stain his soul by denying what he believed to
      be true. He was taken from his cell by the priests, by those who loved
      their enemies, led to the place of execution. He was clad in a robe on
      which representations of devils had been painted—the devils that
      were soon to claim his soul. He was chained to a stake and about his body
      the wood was piled. Then priests, followers of Christ, lighted the fagots
      and flames consumed the greatest, the most perfect martyr, that ever
      suffered death.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet the Italian agent of God, the infallible Leo XIII., only a few
      years ago, denounced Bruno, the "bravest of the brave," as a coward.
    </p>
<p>
      The church murdered him, and the pope maligned his memory. Fagot and
      falsehood—two weapons of the church.
    </p>
<p>
      A little while ago a few men began to examine rocks and soils, mountains,
      islands, reefs and seas. They noticed the valleys and deltas that had been
      formed by rivers, the many strata of lava that had been changed to soil,
      the vast deposits of metals and coal, the immense reefs that the coral had
      formed, the work of glaciers in the far past, the production of soil by
      the disintegration of rock, by the growth and decay of vegetation and the
      countless evidences of the countless ages through which the Earth has
      passed. The geologists read the history of the world written by wave and
      flame, attested by fossils, by the formation of rocks, by mountain ranges,
      by volcanoes, by rivers, islands, continents and seas.
    </p>
<p>
      The geology of the Bible—of the "divinely inspired" church, of the
      "infallible" pope, was found to be utterly false and foolish.
    </p>
<p>
      The Earth became a witness against the creeds of superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      Then came Watt and Galvani with the miracles of steam and electricity,
      while countless inventors created the wonderful machines that do the work
      of the world. Investigation took the place of credulity. Men became
      dissatisfied with huts and rags, with crusts and creeds. They longed for
      the comforts, the luxuries of life. The intellectual horizon enlarged, new
      truths were discovered, old ideas were thrown aside, the brain was
      developed, the heart civilized and science was born. Humboldt, Laplace and
      hundreds of others explained the phenomena of nature, called attention to
      the ancient and venerable mistakes of sanctified ignorance and added to
      the sum of knowledge. Darwin and Haeckel gave their conclusions to the
      world. Men began to really think, the myths began to fade, the miracles to
      grow mean and small, and the great structure, known as theology, fell with
      a crash.
    </p>
<p>
      Science denies the truth of myth and miracle, denies that human testimony
      can substantiate the miraculous, denies the existence of the supernatural.
      Science asserts the absolute, the unvarying uniformity of nature. Science
      insists that the present is the child of all the past,—that no power
      can change the past, and that nature is forever the same.
    </p>
<p>
      The chemist has found that just so many atoms of one kind unite with just
      so many of another—no more, no less, always the same. No caprice in
      chemistry; no interference from without.
    </p>
<p>
      The astronomers know that the planets remain in their orbits—that
      their forces are constant. They know that light is forever the same,
      always obeying the angle of incidence, traveling with the same rapidity,—casting
      the same shadow, under the same circumstances in all worlds. They know
      that the eclipses will occur at the times foretold—neither hastening
      nor delaying. They know that the attraction of gravitation is always the
      same, always in perfect proportion to mass and distance, neither weaker
      nor stronger, unvarying forever. They know that the facts in nature cannot
      be changed or destroyed, and that the qualities of all things are eternal.
    </p>
<p>
      The men of science know that the atomic integrity of the metals is always
      the same, that each metal is true to its nature and that the particles
      cling to each other with the same tenacity,—the same force. They
      have demonstrated the persistence of force, that it is forever active,
      forever the same, and that it cannot be destroyed.
    </p>
<p>
      These great truths have revolutionized the thought of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      Every art, every employment, all study, all experiment, the value of
      experience, of judgment, of hope, all rest on a belief in the uniformity
      of nature, on the eternal persistence and indestructibility of force.
    </p>
<p>
      Break one link in the infinite chain of cause and effect, and the Master
      of Nature appears. The broken link would become the throne of a god.
    </p>
<p>
      The uniformity of Nature denies the supernatural and demonstrates that
      there is no interference from without. There is no place, no office left
      for gods. Ghosts fade from the brain and the shrivelled deities fall
      palsied from their thrones.
    </p>
<p>
      The uniformity of Nature renders a belief in "special providence"
      impossible. Prayer becomes a useless agitation of the air, and religious
      ceremonies are but motions, pantomimes, mindless and meaningless.
    </p>
<p>
      The naked savage, worshiping a wooden god, is the religious equal of the
      robed pope kneeling before an image of the Virgin. The poor African who
      carries roots and bark to protect himself from evil spirits is on the same
      intellectual plane of one who sprinkles his body with "holy water."
    </p>
<p>
      All the creeds of Christendom, all the religions of the heathen world are
      equally absurd. The cathedral, the mosque and the joss house have the same
      foundation. Their builders do not believe in the uniformity of Nature, and
      the business of all priests is to induce a so-called infinite being to
      change the order of events, to make causes barren of effects and to
      produce effects without, and in spite of, natural causes. They all believe
      in the unthinkable and pray for the impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Science teaches us that there was no creation and that there can be no
      destruction. The infinite denies creation and defies destruction. An
      infinite person, an "infinite being" is an infinite impossibility. To
      conceive of such a being is beyond the power of the mind. Yet all
      religions rest upon the supposed existence of the unthinkable, the
      inconceivable. And the priests of these religions pretend to be perfectly
      familiar with the designs, will, and wishes of this unthinkable, this
      inconceivable.
    </p>
<p>
      Science teaches that that which really is has always been, that behind
      every effect is the efficient and necessary cause, that there is in the
      universe neither chance nor interference, and that energy is eternal. Day
      by day the authority of the theologian grows weaker and weaker. As the
      people become intelligent they care less for preachers and more for
      teachers. Their confidence in knowledge, in thought and investigation
      increases. They are eager to know the discoveries, the useful truths, the
      important facts made, ascertained and demonstrated by the explorers in the
      domain of the natural. They are no longer satisfied with the platitudes of
      the pulpit, and the assertions of theologians. They are losing confidence
      in the "sacred Scriptures" and in the protecting power and goodness of the
      supernatural. They are satisfied that credulity is not a virtue and that
      investigation is not a crime.
    </p>
<p>
      Science is the providence of man, the worker of true miracles, of real
      wonders. Science has "read a little in Nature's infinite book of secrecy."
      Science knows the circuits of the winds, the courses of the stars. Fire is
      his servant, and lightning his messenger. Science freed the slaves and
      gave liberty to their masters. Science taught man to enchain, not his
      fellows, but the forces of nature, forces that have no backs to be
      scarred, no limbs for chains to chill and eat, forces that have no hearts
      to break, forces that never know fatigue, forces that shed no tears.
      Science is the great physician. His touch has given sight. He has made the
      lame to leap, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and in the pallid face
      his hand has set the rose of health. Science has given his beloved sleep
      and wrapped in happy dreams the throbbing nerves of pain. Science is the
      destroyer of disease, builder of happy homes, the preserver of life and
      love. Science is the teacher of every virtue, the enemy of every vice.
      Science has given the true basis of morals, the origin and office of
      conscience, revealed the nature of obligation, of duty, of virtue in its
      highest, noblest forms, and has demonstrated that true happiness is the
      only possible good. Science has slain the monsters of superstition, and
      destroyed the authority of inspired books. Science has read the records of
      the rocks, records that priestcraft cannot change, and on his wondrous
      scales has weighed the atom and the star.
    </p>
<p>
      Science has founded the only true religion. Science is the only Savior of
      this world.
    </p>
<p>
      VI.
    </p>
<p>
      FOR many ages religion has been tried. For countless centuries man has
      sought for help from heaven. To soften the heart of God, mothers
      sacrificed their babes! but the God did not hear, did not see, and did not
      help. Naked savages were devoured by beasts, bitten by serpents, killed by
      flood and frost. They prayed for help, but their God was deaf. They built
      temples and altars, employed priests and gave of their substance, but the
      volcano destroyed and the famine came. For the sake of God millions
      murdered their fellow-men, but the God was silent. Millions of martyrs
      died for the honor of God, but the God was blind. He did not see the
      flames, the scaffolds. He did not hear the prayers, the groans. Thousands
      of priests in the name of God tortured their fellow-men, stretched them on
      racks, crushed their feet in iron boots, tore out their tongues,
      extinguished their eyes. The victims implored the protection of God, but
      their god did not hear, did not see. He was deaf and blind. He was willing
      that his enemies should torture his friends.
    </p>
<p>
      Nations tried to destroy each other for the sake of God, and the banner of
      the cross dripping with blood floated over a thousand fields—but the
      god was silent. He neither knew nor cared. Pestilence covered the earth
      with dead, the priests prayed, the altars were heaped with sacrifices, but
      the god did not see, did not hear. The miseries of the world did not
      lessen the joys of heaven. The clouds gave no rain, the famine came,
      withered babes with pallid lips sought the breasts of dead mothers, while
      starving fathers knelt and prayed, but the god did not hear. Through many
      centuries millions were enslaved, babes were sold from mothers, husbands
      from wives, backs were scarred with the lash. The poor wretches lifted
      their clasped hands toward heaven and prayed for justice, for liberty—but
      their god did not hear. He cared nothing for the sufferings of slaves,
      nothing for the tears of wives and mothers, nothing for the agony of men.
      He answered no prayers. He broke no chains. He freed no slaves.
    </p>
<p>
      The miserable wretches appealed to the priests of God, but they were on
      the other side. They defended the masters. The slaves had nothing to give.
    </p>
<p>
      During all these years it was claimed by the theologians that their God
      was governing the world, that he was infinitely powerful, wise and good—and
      that the "powers" of the earth were "ordained" by him. During all these
      years the church was the enemy of progress. It hated all physicians and
      told the people to rely on prayer, amulets and relics. It persecuted the
      astronomers and geologists, denounced them as infidels and atheists, as
      enemies of the human race. It poisoned the fountains of learning and
      insisted that teachers should distort the facts in nature to the end that
      they might harmonize with the "inspired" book. During all these years the
      church misdirected the energies of man, and when it reached the zenith of
      its power, darkness fell upon the world.
    </p>
<p>
      In all nations and in all ages, religion has failed. The gods have never
      interfered. Nature has produced and destroyed without mercy and without
      hatred. She has cared no more for man than for the leaves of the forest,
      no more for nations than for hills of ants, nothing for right or wrong,
      for life or death, for pain or joy.
    </p>
<p>
      Man through his intelligence must protect himself. He gets no help from
      any other world. The church has always claimed and still claims that it is
      the only reforming power, that it makes men honest, virtuous and merciful,
      that it prevents violence and war, and that without its influence the race
      would return to barbarism.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can exceed the absurdity of these claims.

      If we wish to improve the condition of mankind—if we wish for nobler
      men and women we must develop the brain, we must encourage thought and
      investigation. We must convince the world that credulity is a vice,—that
      there is no virtue in believing without, or against evidence, and that the
      really honest man is true to himself. We must fill the world with
      intellectual light. We must applaud mental courage. We must educate the
      children, rescue them from ignorance and crime. School-houses are the real
      temples, and teachers are the true priests. We must supply the wants of
      the mind, satisfy the hunger of the brain. The people should be familiar
      with the great poets, with the tragedies of �?schylus, the dramas
      of Shakespeare, with the poetry of Homer and Virgil. Shakespeare should be
      taught in every school, found in every house.

      Through photography the whole world may become acquainted with the great
      statues, the great paintings, the victories of art. In this way the mind
      is enlarged, the sympathies quickened, the appreciation of the beautiful
      intensified, the taste refined and the character ennobled.
    </p>
<p>
      The great novels should be read by all. All should be acquainted with the
      men and women of fiction, with the ideal world. The imagination should be
      developed, trained and strengthened. Superstition has degraded art and
      literature. It gave us winged monsters, scenes from heaven and hell,
      representations of gods and devils, sculptured the absurd and painted the
      impossible in the name of Art. It gave us the dreams of the insane, the
      lives of fanatical saints, accounts of miracles and wonders, of cures
      wrought by the bones of the dead, descriptions of Paradise, purgatory and
      the eternal dungeon, discourses on baptism, on changing wine and wafers
      into the the blood and flesh of God, on the forgiveness of sins by
      priests, on fore-ordination and accountability, predestination and free
      will, on devils, ghosts and goblins, the ministrations of guardian angels,
      the virtue of belief and the wickedness of doubt. And this was called
      "sacred literature."
    </p>
<p>
      The church taught that those who believed, counted beads, mumbled prayers,
      and gave their time or property for the support of the gospel were the
      good and that all others were traveling the "broad road" to eternal pain.
      According to the theologians, the best people, the saints, were dead, and
      real beauty was to be found only in heaven. They denounced the joys of
      life as husks and filthy rags, declared that the world had been cursed,
      and that it brought forth thistles and thorns because of the sins of man.
      They regarded the earth as a kind of dock, running out into the sea of
      eternity,—on which the pious waited for the ship on which they were
      to be transported to another world.
    </p>
<p>
      But the real poets and the real artists clung to this world, to this life.
      They described and represented things that exist. They expressed thoughts
      of the brain, emotions of the heart, the griefs and joys, the hope and
      despair of men and women. They found strength and beauty on every hand.
      They found their angels here. They were true to human experience and they
      touched the brain and heart of the world. In the tragedies and comedies of
      life, in the smiles and tears, in the ecstasies of love, in the darkness
      of death, in the dawn of hope, they found their materials for statue and
      song, for poem and painting. Poetry and art are the children of this
      world, born and nourished here. They are human. They have left the winged
      monsters of heaven, the malicious deformities of hell, and have turned
      their attention to men and women, to the things of this life.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a poem called "The Skylark," by Shelley, graceful as the motions
      of flames. Another by Robert Burns, called "The Daisy," exquisite, perfect
      as the pearl of virtue in the beautiful breast of a loving girl. Between
      this lark and this daisy, neither above nor below, you will find all the
      poetry of the world. Eloquence, sublimity, poetry and art must have the
      foundation of fact, of reality. Imaginary worlds and beings are nothing to
      us.
    </p>
<p>
      At last the old creeds are becoming cruel and vulgar. We now have
      imagination enough to put ourselves in the place of others. Believers in
      hell, in eternal pain, like murderers, lack imagination. The murderer has
      not imagination enough to see his victim dead. He does not see the
      sightless and pathetic eyes. He does not see the widow's arms about the
      corpse, her lips upon the dead. He does not hear the sobs of children. He
      does not see the funeral. He does not hear the clods as they fall on the
      coffin. He does not feel the hand of arrest, the scene of the trial is not
      before him. He does not hear the awful verdict, the sentence of the court,
      the last words. He does not see the scaffold, nor feel about his throat
      the deadly noose.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us develop the brain, civilize the heart, and give wings to the
      imagination.
    </p>
<p>
      VII.
    </p>
<p>
      IF we abandon myth and miracle, if we discard the supernatural and the
      scheme of redemption, how are we to civilize the world?
    </p>
<p>
      Is falsehood a reforming power? Is credulity the mother of virtue? Is
      there any saving grace in the impossible and absurd? Did wisdom perish
      with the dead? Must the civilized accept the religion of savages?
    </p>
<p>
      If we wish to reform the world we must rely on truth, on fact, on reason.
      We must teach men that they are good or bad for themselves, that others
      cannot be good or bad for them, that they cannot be charged with the
      crimes, or credited with the virtues of others. We must discard the
      doctrine of the atonement, because it is absurd and immoral. We are not
      accountable for the sins of "Adam" and the virtues of Christ cannot be
      transferred to us. There can be no vicarious virtue, no vicarious vice.
      Why should the sufferings of the innocent atone for the crimes of the
      guilty. According to the doctrine of the atonement right and wrong do not
      exist in the nature of things, but in the arbitrary will of the Infinite.
      This is a subversion of all ideas of justice and mercy.
    </p>
<p>
      An act is good, bad, or indifferent, according to its consequences. No
      power can step between an act and its natural consequences. A governor may
      pardon the criminal, but the natural consequences of the crime remain
      untouched. A god may forgive, but the consequences of the act forgiven,
      are still the same. We must teach the world that the consequences of a bad
      action cannot be avoided, that they are the invisible police, the unseen
      avengers, that accept no gifts, that hear no prayers, that no cunning can
      deceive.
    </p>
<p>
      We do not need the forgiveness of gods, but of ourselves and the ones we
      injure. Restitution without repentance is far better than repentance
      without restitution.
    </p>
<p>
      We know nothing of any god who rewards, punishes or forgives.
    </p>
<p>
      We must teach our fellow-men that honor comes from within, not from
      without, that honor must be earned, that it is not alms, that even an
      infinite God could not enrich the beggar's palm with the gem of honor.
    </p>
<p>
      Teach them also that happiness is the bud, the blossom and the fruit of
      good and noble actions, that it is not the gift of any god; that it must
      be earned by man—must be deserved.
    </p>
<p>
      In this world of ours there is no magic, no sleight-of-hand, by which
      consequences can be made to punish the good and reward the bad.
    </p>
<p>
      Teach men not to sacrifice this world for some other, but to turn their
      attention to the natural, to the affairs of this life. Teach them that
      theology has no known foundation, that it was born of ignorance and fear,
      that it has hardened the heart, polluted the imagination and made fiends
      of men.
    </p>
<p>
      Theology is not for this world. It is no part of real religion. It has
      nothing to do with goodness or virtue. Religion does not consist in
      worshiping gods, but in adding to the well-being, the happiness of man. No
      human being knows whether any god exists or not, and all that has been
      said and written about "our god," or the gods of other people, has no
      known fact for a foundation. Words without thoughts, clouds without rain.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us put theology out of religion.
    </p>
<p>
      Church and state should be absolutely divorced. Priests pretend that they
      have been selected by, and that they get their power from God. Kings
      occupy their thrones in accordance with the will of God. The pope declares
      that he is the agent, the deputy of God and that by right he should rule
      the world. All these pretentions and assertions are perfectly absurd and
      yet they are acknowledged and believed by millions. Get theology out of
      government and kings will descend from their thrones. All will admit that
      governments get their powers from the consent of the governed, and that
      all persons in office are the servants of the people. Get theology out of
      government and chaplains will be dismissed from Legislatures, from
      Congress, from the army and navy. Get theology out of government and
      people will be allowed to express their honest thoughts about "inspired
      books" and superstitious creeds. Get theology out of government and
      priests will no longer steal a seventh of our time. Get theology out of
      government and the clergy will soon take their places with augurs and
      soothsayers, with necromancers and medicine-men.
    </p>
<p>
      Get theology out of education. Nothing should be taught in a school that
      somebody does not know.
    </p>
<p>
      There are plenty of things to be learned about this world, about this
      life. Every child should be taught to think, and that it is dangerous not
      to think. Children should not be taught the absurdities, the cruelties and
      imbecilities of superstition. No church should be allowed to control the
      common school, and public money should not be divided between the hateful
      and warring sects. The public school should be secular, and only the
      useful should be taught. Many of our colleges are under the control of
      churches. Presidents and professors are mostly ministers of the gospel and
      the result is that all facts inconsistent with the creeds are either
      suppressed or denied. Only those professors who are naturally stupid or
      mentally dishonest can retain their places. Those who tell the truth, who
      teach the facts, are discharged.
    </p>
<p>
      In every college truth should be a welcome guest. Every professor should
      be a finder, and every student a learner, of facts. Theology and
      intellectual dishonesty go together. The teacher of children should be
      intelligent and perfectly sincere.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us get theology out of education.
    </p>
<p>
      The pious denounce the secular schools as godless. They should be. The
      sciences are all secular, all godless. Theology bears the same relation to
      science that the black art does to chemistry, that magic does to
      mathematics. It is something that cannot be taught, because it cannot be
      known. It has no foundation in fact. It neither produces, nor accords
      with, any image in the mind. It is not only unknowable but unthinkable.
      Through hundreds and thousands of generations men have been discussing,
      wrangling and fighting about theology. No advance has been made. The robed
      priest has only reached the point from which the savage tried to start.
    </p>
<p>
      We know that theology always has and always will make enemies. It sows the
      seeds of hatred in families and nations. It is selfish, cruel, revengeful
      and malicious. It has heaven for the few and perdition for the many. We
      now know that credulity is not a virtue and that intellectual courage is.
      We must stop rewarding hypocrisy and bigotry. We must stop persecuting the
      thinkers, the investigators, the creators of light, the civilizers of the
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      VIII.
    </p>
<p>
      WILL the unknown, the mysteries of life and itiations of the mind, forever
      furnish food for superstition? Will the gods and ghosts perish or simply
      retreat before the advancing hosts of science, and continue to crouch and
      lurk just beyond the horizon of the known? Will darkness forever be the
      womb and mother of the supernatural?
    </p>
<p>
      A little while ago priests told peasants that the New Jerusalem, the
      celestial city was just above the clouds. They said that its walls and
      domes and spires were just beyond the reach of human sight. The telescope
      was invented and those who looked at the wilderness of stars, saw no city,
      no throne. They said to the priests: "Where is your New Jerusalem?" The
      priests cheerfully and confidently replied. "It is just beyond where you
      see."
    </p>
<p>
      At one time it was believed that a race of men existed "with their heads
      beneath their shoulders." Returning travelers from distant lands were
      asked about these wonderful people and all replied that they had not seen
      them. "Oh," said the believers in the monsters, "the men with heads
      beneath their shoulders live in a country that you did not visit." And so
      the monsters lived and flourished until all the world was known. We cannot
      know the universe. We cannot travel infinite distances, and so, somewhere
      in shoreless space there will always be room for gods and ghosts, for
      heavens and hells. And so it may be that superstition will live and linger
      until the world becomes intelligent enough to build upon the foundation of
      the known, to keep the imagination within the domain of the probable, and
      to believe in the natural—<i>until the supernatural shall have been
      demonstrated</i>.
    </p>
<p>
      Savages knew all about gods, about heavens and hells before they knew
      anything about the world in which they lived. They were perfectly familiar
      with evil spirits, with the invisible phantoms of the air, long before
      they had any true conception of themselves. So, they knew all about the
      origin and destiny of the human race. They were absolutely certain about
      the problems, the solution of which, philosophers know, is beyond the
      limitations of the mind. They understood astrology, but not astronomy,
      knew something of magic, but nothing about chemistry. They were wise only
      as to those things about which nothing can be known.
    </p>
<p>
      The poor Indian believed in the "Great Spirit" and saw "design" on every
      hand.—Trees were made that he might have bows and arrows, wood for
      his fire and bark for his wigwam—rivers and lakes to give him fish,
      wild beasts and corn that he might have food, and the animals had skins
      that he might have clothes.
    </p>
<p>
      Primitive peoples all reasoned in the same way, and modern Christians
      follow their example. They knew but little of the world and thought that
      it had been made expressly for the use of man. They did not know that it
      was mostly water, that vast regions were locked in eternal ice and that in
      most countries the conditions were unfavorable to human life. They knew
      nothing of the countless enemies of man that live unseen in water, food
      and air. Back of the little good they knew they put gods and back of the
      evil, devils. They thought it of the greatest importance to gain the good
      will of the gods, who alone could protect them from the devils. Those who
      worshiped these gods, offered sacrifices, and obeyed priests, were
      considered loyal members of the tribe or community, and those who refused
      to worship were regarded as enemies and traitors. The believers, in order
      to protect themselves from the anger of the gods, exiled or destroyed the
      infidels.
    </p>
<p>
      Believing as they did, the course they pursued was natural. They not only
      wished to protect themselves from disease and death, from pestilence and
      famine in this world but the souls of their children from eternal pain in
      the next. Their gods were savages who demanded flattery and worship not
      only, but the acceptance of a certain creed. As long as Christians believe
      in eternal punishment they will be the enemies of those who investigate
      and contend for the authority of reason, of those who demand evidence, who
      care nothing for the unsupported assertions of the dead or the illogical
      inferences of the living.
    </p>
<p>
      Science always has been, is, and always will be modest, thoughtful,
      truthful. It has but one object: The ascertainment of truth. It has no
      prejudice, no hatred. It is in the realm of the intellect and cannot be
      swayed or changed by passion. It does not try to please God, to gain
      heaven or avoid hell. It is for this world, for the use of man. It is
      perfectly candid. It does not try to conceal, but to reveal. It is the
      enemy of mystery, of pretence and canc. It does not ask people to be
      solemn, but sensible. It calls for and insists on the use of all the
      senses, of all the faculties of the mind. It does not pretend to be "holy"
      or "inspired." It courts investigation, criticism and even denial. It asks
      for the application of every test, for trial by every standard. It knows
      nothing of blasphemy and does not ask for the imprisonment of those who
      ignorantly or knowingly deny the truth. The good that springs from a
      knowledge of the truth is the only reward it offers, and the evil
      resulting from ignorance is the only punishment it threatens. Its effort
      is to reform the world through intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      On the other hand theology is, always has been, and always will be,
      ignorant, arrogant, puerile and cruel. When the church had power,
      hypocrisy was crowned and honesty imprisoned. Fraud wore the tiara and
      truth was a convict, Liberty was in chains, Theology has always sent the
      worst to heaven, the best to hell.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me give you a scene from the day of judgment. Christ is upon his
      throne, his secretary by his side. A soul appears. This is what happens—
    </p>
<p>
      "What is your name?"
    </p>
<p>
      Torquemada.
    </p>
<p>
      "Were you a Christian?"
    </p>
<p>
      I was.
    </p>
<p>
      "Did you endeavor to convert your fellow-men?"
    </p>
<p>
      I did. I tried to convert them by persuasion, by preaching and praying and
      even by force.
    </p>
<p>
      "What did you do?"
    </p>
<p>
      I put the heretics in prison, in chains. I tore out their tongues, put out
      their eyes, crushed their bones, stretched them upon racks, roasted their
      feet, and if they remained obdurate I flayed them alive or burned them at
      the stake.
    </p>
<p>
      "And did you do all this for my glory?"
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, all for you. I wanted to save some, I wanted to protect the young and
      the weak minded.
    </p>
<p>
      "Did you believe the Bible, the miracles—that I was God, that I was
      born of a virgin and kept money in the mouth of a fish?"
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I believed it all. My reason was the slave of faith.
    </p>
<p>
      "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joys of thy
      Lord. I was hungry and you gave me meat, naked and you clothed me.."
      Another soul arises.
    </p>
<p>
      "What is your name?"
    </p>
<p>
      Giordano Bruno.
    </p>
<p>
      "Were you a Christian?"
    </p>
<p>
      At one time I was, but for many years I was a philosopher, a seeker after
      truth.
    </p>
<p>
      "Did you seek to convert your fellow-men?"
    </p>
<p>
      Not to Christianity, but to the religion of reason. I tried to develop
      their minds, to free them from the slavery of ignorance and superstition.
      In my day the church taught the holiness of credulity—the virtue of
      unquestioning obedience, and in your name tortured and destroyed the
      intelligent and courageous. I did what I could to civilize the world, to
      make men tolerant and merciful, to soften the hearts of priests, and
      banish torture from the world. I expressed my honest thoughts and walked
      in the light of reason.
    </p>
<p>
      "Did you believe the Bible, the miracles? Did you believe that I was God,
      that I was born of a virgin and that I suffered myself to be killed by the
      Jews to appease the wrath of God—that is, of myself—so that
      God could save the souls of a few?"
    </p>
<p>
      "No, I did not. I did not believe that God was ever born into my world, or
      that God learned the trade of a carpenter, or that he 'increased in
      knowledge,' or that he cast devils out of men, or that his garments could
      cure diseases, or that he allowed himself to be murdered, and in the hour
      of death "forsook" himself. These things I did not and could not believe.
      But I did all the good I could. I enlightened the ignorant, comforted the
      afflicted, defended the innocent, divided even my poverty with the poor,
      and did the best I could to increase the happiness of my fellow-men. I was
      a soldier in the army of progress.—I was arrested, imprisoned, tried
      and convicted by the church—by the 'Triumphant Beast.' I was burned
      at the stake by ignorant and heartless priests and my ashes given to the
      winds."
    </p>
<p>
      Then Christ, his face growing dark, his brows contracted with wrath, with
      uplifted hands, with half averted face, cries or rather shrieks: "Depart
      from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his
      angels."
    </p>
<p>
      This is the justice of God—the mercy of the compassionate Christ.
      This is the belief, the dream and hope of the orthodox theologian—"the
      consummation devoutly to be wished."
    </p>
<p>
      Theology makes God a monster, a tyrant, a savage; makes man a servant, a
      serf, a slave; promises heaven to the obedient, the meek, the frightened,
      and threatens the self-reliant with the tortures of hell.
    </p>
<p>
      It denounces reason and appeals to the passions—to hope and fear. It
      does not answer the arguments of those who attack, but resorts to
      sophistry, falsehood and slander. It is incapable of advancement. It keeps
      its back to the sunrise, lives on myth and miracle, and guards with a
      misers care the "sacred" superstitions of the past.
    </p>
<p>
      In the great struggle between the supernatural and the natural, between
      gods and men, we have passed midnight. All the forces of civilization, all
      the facts that have been found, all the truths that have been discovered
      are the allies of science—the enemies of the supernatural.
    </p>
<p>
      We need no myths, no miracles, no gods, no devils.
    </p>
<p>
      IX.
    </p>
<p>
      FOR thousands of generations the myths have been taught and the miracles
      believed. Every mother was a missionary and told with loving care the
      falsehoods of "faith" to her babe. The poison of superstition was in the
      mother's milk. She was honest and affectionate and her character, her
      goodness, her smiles and kisses, entered into, mingled with, and became a
      part of the superstition that she taught. Fathers, friends and priests
      united with the mothers, and the children thus taught, became the teachers
      of their children and so the creeds were kept alive.
    </p>
<p>
      Childhood loves the romantic, the mysterious, the monstrous. It lives in a
      world where cause has nothing to do with effect, where the fairy waves her
      hand and the prince appears. Where wish creates the thing desired and
      facts become the slaves of amulet and charm. The individual lives the life
      of the race, and the child is charmed with what the race in its infancy
      produced.
    </p>
<p>
      There seems to be the same difference between mistakes and facts that
      there is between weeds and corn. Mistakes seem to take care of themselves,
      while the facts have to be guarded with all possible care. Falsehoods like
      weeds flourish without care. Weeds care nothing for soil or rain. They not
      only ask no help but they almost defy destruction. In the minds of
      children, superstitions, legends, myths and miracles find a natural, and
      in most instances a lasting home. Thrown aside in manhood, forgotten or
      denied, in old age they oft return and linger to the end.
    </p>
<p>
      This in part accounts for the longevity of religious lies. Ministers with
      clasped hands and uplifted eyes ask the man who is thinking for himself
      how he can be wicked and heartless enough to attack the religion of his
      mother. This question is regarded by the clergy as unanswerable. Of course
      it is not to be asked by the missionaries, of the Hindus and the Chinese.
      The heathen are expected to desert the religion of their mothers as Christ
      and his apostles deserted the religion of their mothers. It is right for
      Jews and heathen, but not for thinkers and philosophers.

      A cannibal was about to kill a missionary for food.
    </p>
<p>
      The missionary objected and asked the cannibal how he could be so cruel
      and wicked.
    </p>
<p>
      The cannibal replied that he followed the example of his mother. "My
      mother," said he, "was good enough for me. Her religion is my religion.
      The last time I saw her she was sitting, propped up against a tree, eating
      cold missionary."

      But now the mother argument has mostly lost its force, and men of mind are
      satisfied with nothing less than truth.

      The phenomena of nature have been investigated and the supernatural has
      not been found. The myths have faded from the imagination, and of them
      nothing remains but the poetic. The miraculous has become the absurd, the
      impossible. Gods and phantoms have been driven from the earth and sky. We
      are living in a natural world.

      Our fathers, some of them, demanded the freedom of religion. We have taken
      another step. We demand the Religion of Freedom.

      O Liberty, thou art the god of my idolatry! Thou art the only deity that
      hateth bended knees. In thy vast and unwalled temple, beneath the roofless
      dome, star-gemmed and luminous with suns, thy worshipers stand erect! They
      do not cringe, or crawl, or bend their foreheads to the earth. The dust
      has never borne the impress of their lips. Upon thy altars mothers do not
      sacrifice their babes, nor men their rights. Thou askest naught from man
      except the things that good men hate—the whip, the chain, the
      dungeon key. Thou hast no popes, no priests, who stand between their
      fellow-men and thee. Thou carest not for foolish forms, or selfish
      prayers. At thy sacred shrine hypocrisy does not bow, virtue does not
      tremble, superstition's feeble tapers do not burn, but Reason holds aloft
      her inextinguishable torch whose holy light will one day flood the world.
